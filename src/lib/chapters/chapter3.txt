Rooftop Access - [ACCESS_DENIED]

0/3 artifacts collected.

Daniel blinked. The words hung in midair before him, luminous and faintly shimmering, like a projection overlaid onto the door. He reached out, half expecting to feel the cold, damp surface beneath his fingers, but his hand passed through empty air. The faint red light of the text didn’t waver.

“Artifacts?” he muttered. Giant sea slugs and clicking monsters, and now this? Seriously. It just kept getting better.

His gaze drifted to the handle of the eighth-floor door. He supposed that ACCESS_DENIED could only mean one thing. He gripped the handle and pulled, but it didn’t so much as budge.

“Figures,” he muttered, stepping back.

His eyes flicked to the text again, the faint 0/3 artifacts collected taunting him like a status bar in a bad mobile game. Something about it felt disturbingly artificial. Almost like a game HUD. That thought sparked something desperate and absurd in his mind.

“Menu,” he said aloud, the word echoing faintly in the empty stairwell.

Nothing.

“Status window. Inventory. Quest log.”

Still nothing.

“Of course not,” he muttered, rubbing his temples. He suddenly felt absurdly self-conscious, as if the walls were watching him make a fool of himself. “Why would I even—? God, I sound like an idiot.”

He shook his head, dragging a hand down his face as he stared at the glowing message. Whatever this was, it wasn’t going to bend to his expectations. The rules, if there even were any, weren’t his to dictate. He needed a plan—or at least a starting point. 

Artifacts. The word hung heavy in his mind, pulling his gaze toward the seventh floor below. Maybe the answer lay there. Maybe that’s where this “game” truly began.

Or maybe it wasn’t a game at all.

The thought prickled at the edges of his mind, unwelcome and unnerving. A HUD projected in midair? Cryptic messages? He’d seen things like this before, but only in the context of games or movies—worlds where nothing was real and the stakes were only as high as the player’s imagination allowed. But this? He could feel the damp chill of the stairwell. Smell the acrid stink of mildew and rot. Hear the faint, wet shlorp of the slug echoing somewhere below. This wasn’t virtual reality—at least, not the kind he’d ever heard of. If it was a simulation, it was perfect in all the ways he didn’t want it to be.

Daniel pushed himself off the railing and began pacing, his bare feet sticking faintly to the damp floor with each step. Could this be some sort of alternate reality? A world where glowing HUDs and quests were just… normal? He grimaced, shaking his head.

His mind reeled as he tried to piece together a rational explanation, but every thought looped back to the same question: How did I even get here?

He stopped pacing, gripping the stairwell railing as his pulse quickened. What if this wasn’t another world or a game? What if it was something worse—something entirely in his own head? A delusion, maybe. A breakdown. It would explain a lot: the absurdity of the HUD, the disappearance of his wounds, and even the creatures he’d fought—could they have been nothing more than figments of a fractured mind? The idea made his stomach churn. 

Daniel shook his head violently, forcing the thought aside. No. He couldn’t afford to go down that rabbit hole. Whether this was real, virtual, or some elaborate hallucination, he still had to survive it. And right now, surviving meant escaping this place. It seemed that the roof was his only realistic option.

His eyes drifted back to the glowing message: 0/3 artifacts collected.

“Alright,” he muttered under his breath, forcing his legs to move. “Let’s start from the beginning.”

He descended the stairs slowly, each step deliberate as his mind raced ahead. If this was some kind of game mechanic, the floor he came from was probably where the artifacts were hidden. But what did they even look like? Would they glow? Would the HUD update when he found one? Or worse—would he have to fight something to claim them?

He tightened his grip on the broken broom handle still clutched in his hand. Whatever waited for him down there, he’d face it. Real or not, he didn’t have any other choice.

The seventh-floor hallway greeted him with its familiar, suffocating stench of mildew and decay. The sticky slime trail glistened faintly under the flickering lights, cutting a shimmering path down the center of the corridor. Daniel stepped gingerly onto the damp tiles, his bare feet peeling faintly with every step. He kept his movements slow and deliberate, his ears straining for any sound beyond the faint hum of the overhead lights.

His eyes darted to the far end of the hallway, where the slug had disappeared earlier. He could still hear the faint echo of its wet, deliberate movements somewhere in the distance. The thought of it sent a shiver down his spine. That thing could be anywhere, its camouflaged form blending seamlessly into the shadows. If he wasn’t careful, he could walk right into it.

And then there were the clicking monsters.

Daniel’s stomach churned at the memory of the creature he’d fought earlier. Its spindly limbs, its grotesque, cephalopod-like head—the way it had lunged at him with those jerky, unnatural movements. He didn’t know if there were more of them, but the possibility made his chest tighten. He could barely handle one; a second would be a death sentence.

His footsteps slowed as his thoughts drifted back to the fight. He could still feel the sharp, cold edge of the creature’s claws as they had barely missed his face. He had moved so quickly, so precisely, anticipating its attacks like he’d been trained to fight his entire life.

But he hadn’t been. Not even close.

Daniel furrowed his brow, his grip on the broom handle tightening. The way he’d fought—it hadn’t been instinct. It was something else. Muscle memory? No, that didn’t make sense. He had never been in a fight before, never thrown a punch that wasn’t meant to be a joke. And yet, in that moment, he had known exactly what to do.

“Something to unpack later,” he muttered under his breath, pushing the thought aside. He couldn’t afford to lose focus, not here.

Daniel scanned the area near the stairwell entrance, his eyes darting to the walls for any sign of a map. Places like this usually had one, right? A neat little chart with labels like You Are Here and helpful arrows pointing toward Reception or Supply Room or Cafeteria. Maybe even something cryptic, like Maintenance Wing—Authorized Personnel Only.

But there was no map. Just a dull, rusted sign bolted to the wall, its paint flaking off in patches. One word stood out, barely legible under the grime: Reception. An arrow pointed down the hallway to his right, the direction the slug had gone earlier.

“Of course,” Daniel muttered, his stomach twisting. Reception was probably his best bet for finding some kind of clue—or, if he was lucky, one of the artifacts.

He tightened his grip on the broken broom handle and started forward, the sticky floor clinging to his bare feet with every step. The peeling sound was faint at first, almost easy to ignore, but as he walked, it grew louder. The slime trail thickened, spreading across the hallway like a slow-moving oil spill. His steps slowed as the resistance increased, his feet tugged back with every movement.

“Great,” he muttered, wincing as his foot stuck particularly hard to the floor. “I’m in a haunted hospital with a killer slug and now I’m playing Twister with the ground. Awesome.”

The air grew heavier as he approached the reception area, the sour, briny stench of the slime thickening to an almost physical presence. His eyes watered as he wiped his sleeve across his nose, trying to block out the smell.

He was only a few steps from the reception desk when something caught his eye—a faint shimmer in the light, barely visible against the backdrop of grime and shadow. His breath caught as he squinted, the realization hitting him like a punch to the gut.

The slug was there.

Its massive, translucent body loomed just ahead, blending seamlessly into the corridor. The faint ripple of light bending around its form was the only clue to its presence. It undulated slowly, its bulk gliding along the floor with a wet, deliberate sound.

Daniel froze, his heart hammering in his chest. “Nope,” he whispered. “Nope, nope, nope.”

The slug shifted slightly, its movements slow but purposeful. Daniel’s stomach churned as he glanced toward the reception desk, its warped surface just a few feet away. If he could get there, he might be able to hide.

He took a cautious step forward, his bare foot peeling away from the sticky floor with an audible schlorp. The sound made his skin crawl, but the slug didn’t react. Another step. Then another. He was almost there.

Schlorp.

The slug’s bulk shifted again, the light shimmering faintly around its edges. Daniel’s pulse spiked, and without thinking, he bolted the last few feet, diving behind the reception desk. The sticky floor fought him the whole way, and he felt a sharp tug as one of his feet refused to move.

He looked back, panic flashing through him as he saw his shoe firmly embedded in the slime.

“Oh, come on!” he hissed, yanking his foot free with a wet squelch. He tugged off the other shoe and tossed it aside, the effort nearly costing him his balance. “You can keep them, you slimy bastard,” he muttered as he scrambled behind the desk, crouching low as his heart pounded in his ears.

The desk offered little comfort. Its warped wood and damp surface smelled faintly of mildew, and the faint sound of the slug’s movements echoed uncomfortably close. Daniel pressed himself against the far side of the desk, his knees drawn to his chest as he clutched the broken broom handle like a lifeline.

“Well, that went great,” he whispered, his voice tinged with a nervous edge. “Lost my shoes, almost got eaten by a slug. At least I’m on a roll.”

The faint ripple of light passed by the edge of the desk, and he held his breath, his body tense. The slug moved slowly, its massive bulk undulating with a sickening rhythm. It didn’t seem to notice him—or if it did, it wasn’t in any hurry to investigate.

Daniel exhaled shakily, his shoulders slumping as the slug’s form disappeared down the hallway. He stared at his bare feet, sticky and smeared with the residue from the slime. “Yeah,” he muttered, shaking his head. “This day just keeps getting better.”

The reception desk was cluttered with debris: crumpled papers, broken pens, a rusted nameplate with unreadable text. A pile of patient files lay haphazardly on the corner of the desk, their edges damp and curling. Daniel’s curiosity flared despite himself. If this was some kind of twisted scavenger hunt, maybe the answers—or one of those so-called artifacts—were buried in these files.

He rifled through the stack quickly, flipping through file after file. Most were mundane, detailing routine admissions, diagnoses, and discharges. None of it felt relevant, and the medical jargon made his eyes glaze over. He shoved the papers aside with a frustrated grunt, the faint rustle echoing in the heavy air.

“Nothing,” he muttered under his breath. “Big surprise.”

Something tugged at the edge of his thoughts, an insistent feeling he couldn’t quite shake. His eyes drifted to the old filing cabinet wedged against the wall behind the desk. It was rusted and dented, its drawers slightly ajar. The feeling grew stronger—a subtle pull, like a whisper in the back of his mind.

Daniel hesitated for a moment before stepping toward the cabinet, his bare feet peeling faintly from the sticky floor. He grasped the top drawer and tugged it open, the metal screeching in protest. Inside was another stack of patient files, but one immediately stood out. Its folder was marked with a strange symbol etched into the corner: a spiral pattern that resembled a conch shell.

He pulled the file free, the damp paper cool against his hands. The symbol seemed almost alive, its edges shimmering faintly in the dim light. Daniel swallowed hard, flipping the folder open. Inside, the documents were filled with dense, technical language and handwritten notes scrawled in the margins. His eyes darted across the pages, the words piecing together a story that made his stomach churn.

The patient had undergone version 1 of an “experimental procedure,” the notes explained. The details were fragmented and riddled with blacked-out text, but the general idea was clear. The procedure involved integrating something referred to only as [REDACTED] into the body of a recently deceased individual. The goal? Temporary reanimation.

Daniel’s breath caught, his fingers tightening on the file as he reread the passage. “Reanimation?” he whispered, the word tasting foreign on his tongue. The notes described how the process was intended to “revitalize the host,” granting limited mobility and awareness for a short period. The results were inconsistent—sometimes catastrophic—but the language was clinical, detached, as if the writers weren’t talking about human beings at all.

His stomach twisted as he turned the page, finding a crude diagram of a human body, overlaid with strange, organic shapes. The accompanying text detailed how the [REDACTED] would bond to the nervous system, overriding natural processes to force the body into motion.

“That can’t be real,” he muttered.

And yet, the creature he’d fought earlier—the jerky, unnatural movements, the glassy, cephalopod-like eyes—it matched the descriptions too well. Had that… thing been a product of this experiment? Had it once been human?

A faint clicking echoed through the hallway, sharp and rhythmic, cutting through the heavy silence like a knife. Daniel’s body tensed, the sound igniting the same cold dread he’d felt during his last encounter with the creatures. He snapped the file shut, the brittle paper crinkling in his grip, and shoved it back into the drawer.

He reached to close the filing cabinet when something caught his eye. His gaze flicked to the small labels on the folders in the "D" section—and stopped. His own name wasn’t there.

Daniel froze, his heart skipping a beat. “Where is my file?” he whispered, his voice barely audible over the persistent clicking. His eyes darted back to the desk where he’d searched earlier, scanning the scattered papers for anything he might have missed. Nothing.

The clicking grew louder, reverberating through the hallway. His stomach churned, but he couldn’t shake the need to know. He yanked open the other drawers, his bare feet squelching faintly against the sticky floor as he rifled through their contents. More files. More symbols. The same spiral shell marking the corners of certain folders.

And then, in the next drawer, he saw it.

A file, faintly damp and marked with the now all-too-familiar conch-like symbol. His name was scrawled across the tab in neat, precise handwriting: KANG, DANIEL.

His breath hitched, the weight of the discovery hitting him like a blow. He stared at the folder for a moment, his fingers trembling as he reached for it. He had no time to process what this meant—no time to read what might be inside—but he knew one thing for sure: he couldn’t leave it here. Not with the clicking growing louder, each sound closer than the last.

Daniel tucked the file under his arm, grabbing his makeshift weapons—the jagged remnants of the broken broom handle—from the desk. The sound of the clicking was almost on top of him now, accompanied by the faint scuttling of sharp claws against tile. Panic surged through him, and he bolted, his bare feet peeling away from the sticky floor with every frantic step.

The slime slowed him, the resistance tugging at his soles as if the floor itself wanted to keep him there. The sour stench clung to him, making his head spin, but he forced himself forward, his breaths ragged as he sprinted down the hallway. He couldn’t afford to stop—not here, not in the open.

His gaze darted wildly, searching for cover. The slug could be anywhere, its camouflaged bulk lurking just out of sight. The thought made his skin crawl, and he didn’t dare risk a glance behind him to confirm whether it was nearby. He rounded a corner, his feet slipping slightly on the slick tiles, and spotted an open doorway.

Without thinking, he threw himself inside, slamming the door shut behind him as quietly as he could. He pressed his back against it, clutching the broom handles tightly in his hands, his chest heaving as he tried to steady his breathing.

The room was dim, lit only by the faint flicker of the failing overhead light. His eyes scanned the space quickly: a small bed shoved against the corner, a desk cluttered with overturned medical equipment, and a single window covered in grime. Nothing moved. Nothing clicked.

Daniel crouched low, his fingers gripping the jagged wood of his weapons as he positioned himself near the door. The faint echo of clicking still lingered outside, distant but unnervingly persistent. He stared at the darkened hallway through the narrow crack beneath the door, every muscle in his body taut with anticipation.

If the creature came through, he’d be ready. Or at least, as ready as he could be. His hands tightened around the splintered wood, his pulse pounding in his ears. He didn’t dare move, didn’t dare breathe too loudly. The only sound in the room was the faint, irregular beat of his own heart.

A sudden, heavy thump against the door made Daniel flinch, the sound reverberating through the room like a hammer blow. He pressed his back harder against the wood, his breath catching as he felt the entire door shudder.

“Oh, come on,” he muttered under his breath, gripping the jagged broom handles tighter.

Another thud. The clicking creature was trying to force its way in, its frantic claws scraping against the metal frame with an unsettling rhythm. Daniel could hear it outside, a grotesque chorus of clicking and scuttling, followed by another crash as it hurled itself against the door. The impact nearly sent him sprawling, and he let out a string of curses, his legs straining to hold the door shut.

“Think, Daniel, think,” he whispered, his voice tight. The creature wasn’t going to stop, and he didn’t have the strength—or the time—to play tug-of-war with a monster.

The banging continued, each slam growing more erratic and desperate. Daniel clenched his jaw, his mind racing. The creature’s rhythm… it was predictable. If he could time it right—

Another slam. Another click.

“One,” he whispered, bracing himself.

Another slam.

“Two.”

He gritted his teeth, his fingers trembling as the door rattled violently against his back.

“Three—now!”

Daniel yanked the door open just as the creature lunged forward. It stumbled through the threshold with a screech, its spindly limbs flailing as it lost its balance. Daniel slipped past it in a single, fluid motion, his bare feet slipping slightly on the slimy floor as he spun around. He slammed the door shut behind him, the sound echoing through the hallway as the creature screeched and scrabbled against the wood.

“Stay in there, you freak,” he hissed, his heart hammering in his chest.

He didn’t wait to see if it would recover. Turning, he bolted down the hallway, his feet peeling away from the sticky floor with every frantic step. The sour stench of the slime was overwhelming, but he pushed through it, his mind racing with a single, desperate prayer: Don’t let the slug be here. Don’t let it be here.

He spotted a door up ahead and reached for the handle, yanking on it with all his strength. Locked. “Dammit!” he swore, his voice cracking as he darted to the next door over. His hand fumbled with the handle, and this time, it turned. The door swung open, and he dove inside, slamming it shut behind him.

Daniel leaned against the door, gasping for air. His entire body trembled as he strained to listen, his ears picking up the faint, distant sound of another door bursting open down the hall. The clicking resumed, accompanied by the sharp scrape of claws against tile. His stomach twisted as he pressed his back harder against the door, willing himself to stay silent.

The sounds grew fainter, then stopped entirely. The hallway outside was still again, but Daniel didn’t move. He stayed pressed against the door for several long moments, his breath coming in shallow, uneven gasps.

Finally, he pushed himself away from the door and turned to survey the room. It was larger than the others he’d seen, its walls lined with cabinets and medical equipment. A faint light flickered overhead, illuminating the cold, sterile surfaces of an operating table in the center of the room.

An operating theater. The sight made his skin crawl.

The table was still stained, faint smears of something dark and dried streaking its surface. Rusted instruments lay scattered across a nearby tray, their edges dulled by time and neglect. The air smelled faintly metallic, tinged with the sharp bite of antiseptic.

Daniel tightened his grip on the broom handles, his eyes scanning the room for anything useful—or dangerous. His breathing slowed, but his chest still ached with the effort of holding the door shut and sprinting down the hall. He stepped forward cautiously, his bare feet sticking slightly to the cold floor.

“What the hell happened in here?” he murmured, his voice barely audible in the oppressive silence. His gaze lingered on the operating table, and a chill ran through him as he imagined what kind of procedures had taken place. The file he’d read earlier—the one about reanimating the dead—flashed in his mind.

Daniel took a shaky step forward and pulled the file bearing his name from under his arm. His heart pounded as he opened it, his breath catching in his throat. Whatever was inside, it had to hold some kind of answer—something that explained what was happening to him, why he was here, why he could move like that in a fight.

But as the file fell open, his hopes were dashed. It was empty, save for a single slip of paper resting in the center. He frowned, lifting it up to the light. Strange, jagged runes were scrawled across the surface in a pattern that made his eyes ache the longer he looked at them. They seemed to shift and pulse faintly, like they weren’t entirely fixed to the paper.

Before he could make sense of the symbols, the familiar glow of the HUD flickered to life in front of him.

Artifact 1/3 found.

Frustration boiled up in his chest, and he let out a sharp, bitter laugh. “Seriously?” he muttered, shaking his head as he crumpled the file in his hand. “This is an artifact? A bunch of scribbles on a napkin? Great. Just great.”

His fingers tightened on the slip of paper. He looked at the symbols again, wondering if they held some deeper meaning—something he could use. But the longer he stared, the more the runes seemed to taunt him, their shapes twisting into an indecipherable mess.

He stuffed the paper into his pocket with a frustrated sigh, forcing himself to take a deep breath. “At least I found one,” he muttered. “One down, two to go.”

His pulse began to slow as he focused on his breathing, the tension in his shoulders easing slightly. But his mind raced with questions. The reanimation experiments, the monstrous creatures, and now this artifact—it all pointed to something far worse than he wanted to admit. Was he part of this somehow? Was he going to end up like the clicker monsters, his body jerked around by something alien and unnatural?

Daniel shuddered, shaking the thought away. “Not happening,” he muttered, his voice firm. “Not if I have any say in it.”

Steeling himself, he turned his attention back to the operating theater. The room felt darker now, the flickering light casting long, jagged shadows that danced across the walls. His eyes swept over the equipment, taking in the crude, rusted tools scattered across the tables and trays. This didn’t feel like a hospital. It felt like a torture chamber.

Scalpels, saws, and other implements lay in disarray, their edges dulled and stained. Daniel grimaced at the sight, but his gaze lingered on a pair of blades lying amidst the mess. They were larger than scalpels, their curved edges serrated and wickedly sharp, even under the layer of grime.

“Better than a broomstick,” he muttered, picking them up. He tested their weight in his hands, the steel cold and heavy but oddly comforting. The jagged broom handles he’d been carrying felt laughably inadequate now. He tossed them aside, gripping the blades tightly.

At least now he wouldn’t feel completely defenseless.

He turned back to the operating table, scanning the room for anything he might have missed. If there was one artifact here, could there be another? Or maybe a clue?
