A bright light flashed and the sound of screeching tires cut through the pitter pattering of rain. For a moment, Daniel thought his world was coming to an end.

“It’s a four-way stop, asshole!” 

Daniel blinked in surprise before hot anger bubbled up inside him. He rolled down his window, teeth grinding in rage.

“Yeah, and I was here first. Fuck you!” he spat back as loudly as he could.

The van in front of him drove off with a squeal. Daniel took a few deep breaths, smirking to himself. “Moron,” he muttered under his breath. This was why he hated driving in Vancouver—too many idiots who thought they knew better than everyone else.

It was your typical stormy winter evening, dark and cloudy with the accompanying miserable downpour of rain, undercut occasionally by a low rumble of thunder. Perfect weather to do fuck-all, if you asked him.

When he reached the casino, the parking lot was jam-packed. He shoved his corolla into a tight parking space on level 4, the screech of his tires drawing annoyed looks from nearby patrons. He ignored them as usual.

Unsurprisingly, the faces leaving the establishment were full of frustration and resignation. Losers. They were probably heading home to mope about their wasted money. Daniel chuckled to himself as he strode past them toward the lobby. He was like them once, but no longer. He’d been on a hot streak for a few weeks now, and things were looking up, actually.

The poker room was dusty as ever, and he recognized a few of the regulars amongst the players. Some of those faces turned sour when they saw him enter the room. One of them, a graying man Daniel vaguely remembered as James, muttered something bitter before leaving the table. Daniel smirked—poor James probably couldn’t handle another beating at his hands.

“Lucky you. Looks like a spot just opened up,” the floor manager said, turning to Daniel. “What’s your name, sir?”

“Daniel Kang.”

“Alright Mr. Kang, please get your chips from the cashier and sit down at table 3.”

Daniel sauntered over to the cashier, his confidence radiating. People didn’t like him because he won. It wasn’t his fault they sucked. With his chips in hand, he plugged in his earphones and scrolled through NewTube. The noise of the room faded into the background as he found a podcast discussing the 2025 stock market.

The host droned on about tech stocks, economic policies, and famous investors making their moves. Daniel barely listened, but he still fantasized about the kind of money they were talking about. He didn’t care about the details—just the image of him, rich and untouchable, shutting up everyone who’d ever doubted him. His parents would have to eat their words. They’d finally see that he wasn’t a screw-up. And Mei? She’d stop her constant nagging once she realized he didn’t need her approval.

Daniel folded a few hands to get a feel for the table. The room was noisy, but his earphones dulled the din. He casually observed the other players, letting his eyes linger on the small tells they didn’t realize they were giving away—the way one man adjusted his glasses when he was bluffing, or the tight grip on a woman’s chips whenever she had a strong hand.

As the blinds came around, Daniel played cautiously at first, letting his stack grow little by little. It wasn’t until a particularly juicy pot came up that he really leaned in. He was holding a mediocre hand—queen-ten offsuit—but something about the guy across from him, a stocky man with a thick beard, felt... off. Daniel couldn’t put it into words, but there was a faint pressure in the air, a dull sensation like static in his chest. It always seemed to flare up when someone was nervous or trying too hard to act natural.

The flop came down: queen of hearts, seven of clubs, two of diamonds. Top pair, weak kicker. Not exactly a hand to write home about. But as the bearded man raised, Daniel’s confidence grew. The man was overplaying his hand; Daniel could feel it. It wasn’t logic—just a faint sense of unease radiating from the guy, like a static charge building in the air.

Daniel called. The turn came: ten of diamonds. Two pair now. The bearded man’s energy shifted—subtle, but noticeable. The dull pressure in Daniel’s chest lifted slightly, replaced by a nervous buzz. Daniel felt his own pulse quicken, but he forced himself to remain calm. He raised.

The river was a five of spades, a harmless card. The bearded man hesitated for a fraction of a second before shoving his stack into the pot.

Daniel stared at the chips, his mind racing. The buzzing in his chest turned almost nauseating now, and he felt the man’s tension like a wave threatening to break. He couldn’t know for sure, but every instinct told him the man was bluffing.

“I call,” Daniel said, his voice calm.

The man slammed his cards down: king-jack offsuit. A complete bluff.

Daniel revealed his hand, and the dealer pushed the massive pile of chips toward him. The room went quiet for a moment, the kind of silence that only comes after a big win. Daniel tried to act nonchalant as he stacked his chips, but he could feel the eyes on him. Jealousy. Frustration. Resentment.

“That’s bullshit!” the bearded man snapped, standing up so fast his chair fell over. “You’ve been winning every damn hand! No one’s that lucky!”

“Yeah,” another player chimed in, glaring at Daniel. “You’re playing too perfect. What, you counting cards or something?”

Daniel shrugged, forcing a smirk as he leaned back in his chair, stacking his chips with deliberate slowness. “Maybe you guys just suck.”

The bearded man across the table slammed his fists on the table, rattling the chips and startling the dealer. “You think this is funny?” he growled, his voice rising above the noise of the poker room. “Nobody wins that much without cheating!”

Daniel’s smirk widened, infuriating the man further. “You’re just mad because I’m better than you,” he said, his tone dripping with condescension. “But hey, if you want me to explain how poker works, I charge by the hour.”

A murmur rippled through the table as the other players shifted uncomfortably. One of them, a wiry man in a baseball cap, spoke up. “Seriously, no one’s that lucky. What’re you doing? Counting cards? Hiding something under the table?”

Daniel scoffed, rolling his eyes dramatically. “Yeah, that’s it. I’ve got X-ray vision, and I can see through the cards. Or maybe,” he leaned forward, his voice mocking, “you guys are just really bad at this.”

The bearded man’s face turned crimson, and he pointed a finger at Daniel. “You’re a goddamn cheat, and you know it! I should’ve known as soon as you walked in here.”

“Right,” Daniel said, standing up and pushing his chair back with a loud scrape. He towered over the table, his smirk now a sneer. “That’s why you’re broke, and I’m walking out with all your money. Because I’m the problem. Get real.”

The floor manager, sensing the tension about to boil over, stepped in quickly. “Gentlemen, let’s keep it civil. Mr. Kang, if you’re cashing out, the cage is over there.”

Daniel turned to the manager with an exaggerated shrug. “See? Even he knows I’m the only one here who isn’t a sore loser.”

He gathered his chips with deliberate flair, making sure to take his time stacking them as the other players glared daggers at him. The bearded man muttered something under his breath, but Daniel ignored it, tossing his earphones into his ears as he strolled toward the cashier with a self-satisfied smirk.

By the time he reached the parking lot, the smugness had begun to fade, replaced by a simmering annoyance. The rain had picked up, drumming on the pavement as he walked. He pulled his jacket tighter, hurrying toward his car, when his phone buzzed. He sighed, already knowing who it was before he answered.

“Yeah, Mei,” he said flatly, unlocking his car.

“Are you at the casino again?” Her tone was sharp, but there was an edge of worry behind it.

“Why do you always assume that?” he shot back, though he didn’t bother denying it.

“Because you’re always there!” she snapped. “Daniel, you said you’d cut back. Do you even hear yourself anymore? This isn’t healthy!”

“Healthy?” Daniel let out a bitter laugh. “You don’t get it, Mei. I’m winning. I’m making money. Or is that too hard for you to believe?”

“Until you don’t,” she said coldly. “You think this streak is going to last forever? You’re going to lose it all one day, and then what? Crawl back to your parents?”

The mention of his parents made his blood boil. “Don’t you dare bring them into this,” he hissed, his grip tightening on the phone. “They’ve never believed in me, and now you’re just like them. Always nagging, always doubting. God, it’s exhausting.”

“I’m trying to help you, Daniel,” she said, her voice softening. “This is getting out of control. If you won’t listen to me, I’ll—”

“You’ll what?” he cut her off, his voice rising. “Call my parents? Go ahead. Maybe they’ll finally have something to talk about at family dinners.”

“Daniel—”

He didn’t let her finish. “Stay the hell out of my business, Mei. You don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Before she could respond, he hung up and tossed the phone onto the passenger seat next to his wads of cash. For a moment, he just sat there, staring at the rain-soaked windshield, his breath coming in sharp, angry bursts.

“They’re all the same,” he muttered to himself, gripping the steering wheel. “They don’t get it. They don’t get me.”

With a growl of frustration, he started the car and pulled out of the parking lot, the tires screeching on the wet pavement. There were other casinos, quieter ones where he wouldn’t have to deal with sore losers. Maybe tonight wasn’t over after all. He drove through the rain-slicked streets, the glow of neon signs and traffic lights casting fragmented reflections on the wet asphalt.

The rain blurred the neon lights as he drove, his mind racing with plans to win even bigger and prove them all wrong. As he pulled into the parking lot of a smaller casino on the outskirts of the city, something nagged at the back of his mind. A black sedan turned into the lot behind him, its headlights cutting through the gloom. He hadn’t noticed it before, but now, parked a few rows over, it sat idling, its driver obscured by the rain-streaked glass.

Daniel’s stomach tightened. Was he just being paranoid? It was probably nothing. Still, he grabbed his wallet and chips and stepped out of the car quickly, his shoes splashing in the shallow puddles. He pulled his jacket tighter and made a beeline for the casino entrance, the glowing sign above promising a warm refuge from the storm.

The sound of a car door slamming stopped him cold.

Daniel turned his head slightly, just enough to catch a shadowy figure moving toward him. His pulse quickened as recognition struck—the bearded man from earlier. His heart sank.

“Hey!” the man barked, his voice gruff and angry. He was already closing the distance, his footsteps splashing in the rain. “You think you can just walk away after cheating us out of our money?”

Daniel didn’t wait for the confrontation. He bolted toward the lobby, the rain stinging his face as he sprinted. The glass doors were just ahead. If he could make it inside, security could—

A sharp, searing pain exploded in his side.

Daniel stumbled forward, his breath catching as his legs gave out beneath him. He hit the pavement hard, the wet surface soaking into his clothes. His hand flew to his side instinctively, and when he pulled it back, it was slick with blood.

“Cheaters like you don’t deserve to walk away,” the bearded man growled, standing over him with a blade in hand. His face twisted with a mix of rage and satisfaction. He reached down, yanking cash from Daniel’s pocket before patting him down for more.

Daniel’s vision blurred, the world around him tilting and spinning. He tried to speak, to shout for help, but only a weak gurgle escaped his lips. The man spat on the ground beside him before turning and walking away, his figure dissolving into the rain.

The pain was unbearable, radiating from his side in sharp, unrelenting waves. His thoughts grew fragmented, slipping away like the water pooling beneath him. He stared up at the stormy sky, the raindrops mixing with the warm blood spreading across his chest.

- break -

Bright lights swirled above him, and muffled voices cut through the haze.

“Severe internal injuries—stab wound to the abdomen.”

“Possible damage to the liver. BP is dropping fast. We need to stabilize him!”

Daniel’s consciousness flickered, fragments of the surgery room searing into his mind like a surreal fever dream. The sterile white lights blurred, and the voices faded into a distant hum. Somewhere deep in the void of his fading awareness, something stirred.

A faint glow emerged in the darkness, pulsing like a heartbeat. At first, it was warm and inviting, pulling Daniel toward it. But as he drifted closer, the glow began to shift, growing jagged and alien. Strange shapes coiled within it, abstract and incomprehensible, their edges writhing like shadows cast by an unseen fire.

Suddenly, he was falling—not through space, but through memories that felt vaguely familiar. He saw flashes of tentacled forms moving through a black ocean, their sheer size and malevolence pressing down on him like a physical weight. A wave of suffocating sadness crashed over him, accompanied by the ghostly cries of people he didn’t recognize but somehow felt he should. Faces blurred together, their expressions twisted in agony before vanishing into the void.

In the final vision, the glow reformed into something towering and incomprehensible. A presence—not human, not even close—loomed over him. It had no face, only an endless depth of shifting patterns and eyes that seemed to look through him. Its silent gaze bore into his very being, and though it didn’t speak, he felt its judgment.

Then it was gone, and he was drowning in darkness.

- break -

Daniel jolted awake, his body drenched in sweat. His heart pounded against his ribs as the steady beeping of the monitor grounded him in the present. The hospital room was unnervingly quiet, and his head throbbed as he struggled to process where he was. The IV drip beside him cast faint shadows on the wall, and the smell of antiseptic filled his nostrils.

He glanced down at his trembling hands. They felt foreign, like they didn’t belong to him anymore. The dream—if it even was a dream—lingered in his mind, sharp and vivid in a way that felt far too real. He pressed his palms to his face, trying to shake the images of tentacles and faceless beings from his thoughts, but they clung to him like cobwebs.

The door creaked open, and a middle-aged doctor stepped inside, clipboard in hand. His expression was calm but tense, his lips pressed into a thin line as he approached Daniel’s bedside.

“Mr. Kang,” the doctor began, his voice gentle but cautious. “How are you feeling?”

Daniel blinked, still struggling to ground himself. “Like I got run over by a truck,” he muttered hoarsely.

The doctor offered a faint, practiced smile before sitting down beside him. “You suffered multiple internal injuries. The stab wound damaged several of your internal organs, including your liver. We were able to stabilize you, but...” He hesitated, his reluctance almost palpable.

Daniel narrowed his eyes, a strange sensation washing over him. He couldn’t explain it, but he felt the doctor’s hesitation, almost as if he already knew what he was going to say. “Just say it,” Daniel said flatly.

The doctor sighed. “Your liver and parts of your intestines sustained irreversible damage. Without a transplant, your condition will continue to deteriorate. We’ve added you to the transplant waiting list, but...”
“But what?” Daniel pressed, his tone sharp despite the weakness in his voice.

“It’s a long process,” the doctor admitted. “Even under urgent circumstances, it could take weeks, months, or longer to find a compatible donor. In the meantime, we’ll do everything we can to manage your condition and keep you stable.”

Daniel stared at the doctor, his face expressionless. He nodded mechanically, the weight of the words barely sinking in. “Okay,” he muttered. “Whatever you need me to sign, just bring it.”

The doctor hesitated again, his concern evident, but eventually nodded. “I’ll have the nurse bring the paperwork shortly. Try to rest for now.”

When the door clicked shut behind him, Daniel let out a shaky breath. His head sank back against the pillow, and he stared at the sterile white ceiling, his mind a storm of confusion and dread. The doctor’s words barely registered. What stuck with him was the dream—those creatures, those cries of anguish, that... thing. It felt less like a hallucination and more like a warning.

He turned his head to the side, catching sight of his phone on the bedside table. Reaching for it, he winced at the pain in his side but managed to grab it. The screen lit up with dozens of missed calls from Mei and a single unread text:

“Text me as soon as you get this.”

Daniel stared at the message, his thumb hovering over the screen. For the first time in a long while, he wasn’t angry or dismissive. Instead, he felt something else entirely: a creeping sense of shame. But even that couldn’t drown out the growing unease in his chest, the nagging feeling that the dream wasn’t done with him yet.

The faint rhythmic beeping of the monitor filled the room as Daniel stared at the ceiling, lost in thought. His hand rested on the phone lying beside him, Mei’s message glowing faintly on the screen. Yet his mind wasn’t on her, or the pain radiating through his body, or even the doctor’s grim prognosis.

He had a feeling—no, a certainty—that someone was coming. Someone who wasn’t a nurse or doctor. His chest tightened, not with fear, but with a strange anticipation.

The door creaked open, and Daniel turned his head slowly. A woman stepped inside, her heels clicking softly against the linoleum floor. She carried a slim leather folder in one hand and moved with the kind of composure that came only from years of practice. Her black pantsuit was perfectly tailored, her dark hair pulled back into a sleek bun. She looked like she’d stepped out of a corporate boardroom, not a hospital.

“Mr. Kang,” she said, her voice smooth and professional, her expression unreadable. “Good evening.”

Daniel didn’t react, his gaze steady as if he’d been expecting her. “You’re late.”

The woman paused, a flicker of surprise flashing across her face before she recovered. “I see,” she said evenly, stepping closer to his bedside. “I wasn’t aware we had an appointment.”

“We don’t,” Daniel replied, his tone calm but cryptic. “But you’re here now. That’s what matters.”

She tilted her head slightly, studying him. “My name is Janice Young. I represent the charitable branch of Arkanis Biotech. We assist patients on the organ transplant waitlist by offering access to an experimental procedure. I believe your doctor mentioned your current condition?”

“Severe internal injuries. Organ failure. Grim odds,” Daniel said, ticking off the words like he was reading a grocery list. “Yeah, I got the memo.”

Janice didn’t react to his flippant tone. “Our procedure is designed to replace damaged organs using cutting-edge bioengineering. The operation is, of course, experimental, but the success rate has been promising.”

“Let me guess,” Daniel said, smirking faintly. “There’s a catch.”

She smiled politely, the kind of practiced smile that never quite reached her eyes. “In exchange for the procedure, recipients are required to sign a ten-year work contract with our organization. It’s a small price to pay for the chance to regain your health.”

Daniel chuckled, the sound low and humorless. “Right. Small price. And I’m sure you’re here out of the goodness of your heart.”

Janice’s smile didn’t waver. “We’re here because we believe in helping people, Mr. Kang. Of course, the work contract ensures our investment is mutually beneficial.”

Daniel turned his head slightly, his eyes narrowing as he studied her. She was good—too good. Every word was measured, every expression carefully controlled. But there was something else beneath the surface, something she wasn’t saying. And Daniel, for reasons he couldn’t quite explain, knew it.

“I’ll do it,” he said abruptly.

Janice blinked, caught off guard for the first time. “You’ll... agree to the procedure?”

“On one condition.” Daniel’s smirk returned, sharper this time. “I want a tier 3 modification.”

The air in the room shifted. Janice’s polite smile faltered for a fraction of a second, her eyes narrowing imperceptibly. “I’m sorry, Mr. Kang,” she said, her voice still smooth but edged with caution. “I’m not sure what you mean.”

“Oh, come on,” Daniel said, waving a hand dismissively. “Don’t insult my intelligence. I know the procedure isn’t just about replacing organs. It’s about modifications. Enhancements. Tier 3, specifically. I’m not interested in just surviving—I want to thrive.”

Janice’s expression hardened, her composure slipping just enough to reveal the sharpness beneath. “How do you know about that?”

Daniel shrugged, his gaze never leaving hers. “Let’s just say I’ve got my sources. Doesn’t really matter how I know, does it? What matters is that I do.”

For the first time, Janice’s voice carried a hint of steel. “You realize that simply knowing what you just said is grounds for... termination.”

Daniel leaned back against the pillow, his smirk widening. “You could kill me, sure. But then you’d lose out on a very good deal.”

Janice’s eyes narrowed further, her hand tightening slightly on the leather folder. “And what deal would that be?”

“You give me the tier 3 modification,” Daniel said, his tone casual but firm. “I go through your little tutorial, and I don’t just survive—I excel. You get to take the credit for my success, for bringing in a star candidate. I’m willing to bet that looks pretty damn good for you, doesn’t it?”

Janice studied him in silence, her gaze sharp and calculating. Daniel could feel her trying to read him, to pick apart his confidence and find the cracks. But he held steady, the faint static buzz in his chest giving him an edge he couldn’t quite explain.

Finally, she smiled again, but this time it didn’t reach her eyes. “You’re very bold, Mr. Kang. Boldness can be... useful. Or it can be fatal.”

“I’ll take my chances,” Daniel replied, his smirk unwavering. “But you’re smart enough to know a good opportunity when you see one. So, do we have a deal?”

Janice didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she closed the folder with a quiet snap and straightened her posture. “I’ll need to make some calls,” she said coolly. “In the meantime, I suggest you rest. You’ll need your strength.”

As she turned to leave, Daniel called after her, his voice laced with mock sincerity. “Looking forward to working with you, Ms. Young.”

She paused at the door, glancing back at him with an unreadable expression. Then she was gone, the sound of her heels fading into the hallway.

Daniel leaned back against the pillow, his smirk fading into a thoughtful frown. Whatever he’d just stepped into, it was bigger than he’d anticipated. But that didn’t matter. He’d already decided—he wasn’t going to let anyone control his fate. Not Janice Young, not Arkanis Biotech, not anyone.

- break -

The days in the hospital passed slowly, the sterile monotony broken only by the occasional visit from a doctor or nurse. They came in with soft voices and practiced professionalism, adjusting his IV drip, checking his vitals, or administering medications. Daniel barely acknowledged them most of the time, his mind elsewhere.

The one message he’d sent to his family—short and to the point—went unanswered. Not that he’d expected much. His parents had long since stopped caring about the details of his life. Maybe they assumed he was exaggerating, or maybe they just didn’t want to deal with him. Either way, the silence stung more than he cared to admit.

But Mei came.

She arrived in the early evening, her expression guarded as she stepped into the room. Daniel looked up from his phone, a brief flicker of hope crossing his face. “Hey,” he said, his voice hoarse.

“Hey,” she replied, closing the door behind her. She stood by the edge of the bed, her arms crossed tightly.

For a moment, neither of them spoke. The tension in the air was palpable, heavy with unspoken words.

“I’ve been thinking,” Daniel began, his voice quieter now. “About everything. About... us.” He hesitated, his hands gripping the thin hospital blanket. “I know I’ve screwed up. I know I’ve said this before, but I mean it this time. No more gambling. I swear.”

Mei’s lips pressed into a thin line, her eyes searching his face. “You’ve said that before,” she said softly. “Do you even remember how many times you’ve promised me that?”

Daniel winced. “This time’s different.”

“Why?” she asked, her voice breaking slightly. “Why should I believe you now?”

He didn’t have an answer. Not a good one, anyway. He opened his mouth to speak but closed it again, his gaze dropping to his lap.

Mei sighed, the sound heavy with exhaustion. “Daniel, I can’t do this anymore. I’ve tried to be there for you. I’ve tried to help. But every time, you just... go back to the same patterns. And I can’t keep waiting for you to change.”

Her words hit him harder than he’d expected. He’d known this was coming—had felt it in the way she’d been pulling away for weeks, maybe months. But hearing it still hurt.

“So that’s it?” he asked, his voice low. “You’re just walking away?”

“I have to,” she said, her voice cracking. “For my own sanity. I can’t take the lies anymore, Daniel.”

She turned to leave, hesitating at the door. “I hope you figure things out. I really do.” Then she was gone.

Daniel sat in silence, the faint beeping of the monitor the only sound in the room. He should’ve felt angry, or sad, or something, but all he felt was... emptiness. Like he’d already lived this moment before and was just going through the motions.

His mind wandered back to the dream—or whatever it was—that had haunted him since the surgery. The fragments were still disjointed, like shards of a shattered mirror, but he couldn’t shake the feeling that they held some kind of meaning. He just didn’t know what yet.

It was late that night, as Daniel lay staring at the ceiling, that he wondered if Ms. Young had decided to kill him after all. He wouldn’t have been surprised. People like her didn’t leave loose ends.

His phone buzzed on the bedside table, cutting through his thoughts. The screen lit up with an unknown number. He hesitated for a moment before answering.

“Hello?”

“Mr. Kang,” came the smooth, familiar voice. “I trust this isn’t a bad time.”

Daniel sat up slightly, his heart beating faster. “Ms. Young.”

“I’ve secured approval for your... special request,” she said, her tone carefully neutral. “A tier 3 modification. Congratulations.”

Daniel exhaled slowly, masking the relief that washed over him. “Impressive. Didn’t think you’d pull it off.”

“It wasn’t easy,” she replied, her voice laced with a hint of irritation. “You’d better hold up your end of the bargain, considering how much trouble I went through for you.”

Daniel smirked, leaning back against the pillows. “Wouldn’t dream of letting you down.”

“Good.” There was a brief pause before she added, “Though I must admit, I’m curious. Are you ever going to tell me how you know about the modifications? Or should I start preparing for more... drastic measures?”

Her tone was playful, but Daniel didn’t miss the edge beneath it. “You can try,” he said cryptically. “But let’s just say I know enough to make our arrangement worthwhile—for both of us.”

Another pause, longer this time. “You’re an interesting man, Mr. Kang,” she said finally. “Stay put. Someone will be there shortly to transport you.”

The line went dead.

Less than an hour later, Daniel heard footsteps approaching his room. The door swung open, and two large men in dark suits stepped inside, their faces devoid of expression. Without a word, one of them wheeled a gurney closer, motioning for Daniel to get on.

“Carting me off like luggage, huh?” Daniel muttered, though his bravado felt hollow. The sharp pain in his side flared as he awkwardly shifted onto the gurney, gritting his teeth against the discomfort.

The men didn’t respond. They simply strapped him in and wheeled him out of the room, the fluorescent hospital lights flashing above him as they moved through the hallways. They exited through a side door, and Daniel felt the chill of the night air before being loaded into the back of a sleek black ambulance. The vehicle was unmarked, its windows tinted to the point of being opaque. Inside, the space was cold and clinical, lit by dim overhead LEDs.

Daniel craned his neck to catch a glimpse out of the small rear window. As the ambulance pulled away, a massive building loomed into view. Sleek and modern, its glass façade reflected the city lights despite the rain-slicked gloom. The facility was huge, its many floors stretching high into the night sky. Daniel wasn’t surprised. It was exactly what he expected from Vancouver’s largest biotech company.

But was it really just a biotech company?

The thought stuck with him, an unease growing as they passed through the gates. The ambulance stopped at a private entrance, and Daniel was wheeled out, the men in suits flanking him as they entered the building. The lobby they passed through was eerily quiet, the kind of sterile silence that made his skin crawl. They stopped at an elevator, and one of the men pressed a keycard against a reader. The doors opened with a soft chime.

Daniel stared at the illuminated panel as they descended, the numbers ticking downward far past what any normal building would require. Sub-level 12. That couldn’t mean anything good.

The elevator doors opened to reveal a stark, brightly lit hallway. The floors were white, the walls white, the lights almost blinding. It felt more like a laboratory than a hospital. At the end of the hall, they entered a large room where other patients waited, seated on identical gurneys. Some looked terrified, others resigned, but none looked like they wanted to be there.

Daniel’s gurney was wheeled to a stop beside the others, and one of the suited men gestured for him to sit up. He did, noting the silent tension in the room. Soon, a tall man in a white lab coat appeared, holding a tablet and a stack of papers. He moved with the clipped efficiency of someone who had done this a hundred times before.

“Good evening,” the doctor said, his tone devoid of warmth. “You’ve all been selected for the experimental modification procedure. In exchange for your participation, you’ll receive state-of-the-art medical treatment and, for those who survive”—he barely paused—“enhanced physical and cognitive abilities.”

The doctor’s eyes swept over the room, lingering for a fraction of a second longer on Daniel than anyone else. “Before we proceed, you’ll need to sign these agreements. By signing, you acknowledge that you are waiving your legal rights to hold the company liable for any adverse effects. These effects may include—but are not limited to—personality changes, memory loss, sensory distortion, or cognitive decline.”

There was a low murmur of unease among the patients, but Daniel stayed silent, his face unreadable. He knew these risks were worse for tier 1 and tier 2 modifications. With a tier 3, he should be safe. Safer, at least.

The doctor began distributing the papers. When he reached Daniel, he paused. “Mr. Kang,” he said, his voice betraying a hint of curiosity. “You’ve been approved for a tier 3 modification. Rare. Fortunate.”

“Lucky me,” Daniel said dryly, taking the pen and signing the document without hesitation. He handed it back, locking eyes with the doctor. The man’s expression didn’t change, but Daniel sensed something beneath it—a flicker of something he couldn’t quite place.

The procedure room was cold. Too cold. Daniel lay strapped to the gurney, his arms and legs restrained. He was dimly aware of the faint hum of machinery and the sterile scent of antiseptic, but his focus was drawn to the muffled screams echoing from adjacent rooms. His stomach twisted, a bead of sweat rolling down his temple despite the chill. For the first time, he wondered if he’d made a mistake.

The door opened, and a team of doctors entered, their faces hidden behind masks. One of them pushed a metal cart toward him, and Daniel’s breath hitched when he saw what lay atop it.

It was... a shell. No, not just a shell. It was shaped like a conch, smooth and glistening, but it pulsed faintly, as though alive. Thin, translucent tentacles writhed from its opening, undulating like they were searching for something. The smell hit him next—acrid, salty, and so deeply wrong that he almost retched.

The lead doctor, the same one who had handed him the contract, placed a hand on the cart. “You’re lucky, Mr. Kang,” he said, his tone almost reverent. “This specimen is one of the rarest we’ve ever acquired. Few are suitable for tier 3 modifications.”

Daniel didn’t respond, his eyes glued to the grotesque object as it was lifted from the cart. The tentacles seemed to twitch more violently as the doctor approached, as if it could sense him.

“This will hurt,” the doctor said clinically, positioning the shell over Daniel’s back.

Daniel felt the cold, slimy surface press against his skin, and then the tentacles began to move. They wriggled with a horrible, wet sound, burrowing into his flesh. He gasped, the pain sharp and immediate despite the analgesic coursing through his veins. His vision swam as the tentacles dug deeper, spreading through his body like icy fire.

The last thing he saw before he blacked out was the faint, otherworldly glow of the shell as it fused to his back. Then there was only darkness.
