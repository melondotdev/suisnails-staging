A bright light flashed and the sound of screeching tires cut through the pitter pattering of rain. For a moment, Daniel thought his world was coming to an end.

“It’s a four-way stop, asshole!” 

Daniel blinked in surprise before hot anger began bubbling up inside him. He rolled down his window, teeth bared in a snarl.

“Yeah, and I was here first. Screw you!” he spat back as loudly as he could.

The van in front of him drove off with a squeal, and Daniel shook his head in disgust. “Moron,” he muttered under his breath. This was why he hated driving in Vancouver—too many idiots who thought they knew better than everyone else.

It was especially annoying to drive during the winter here. Not only did the sun go down as early as 4 PM, but rainfall was almost a daily occurrence. It was particularly bad when the roads would freeze over during the night. Today was a perfect example of how miserable a downpour-turned-ice-hell could be—slippery as hell and a cause for some next-level ass clenching.

No-one in the right mind should’ve been out at 1 AM in the morning on a night like this one, but when he reached the casino, the parking lot was jam-packed—a symptom of the cancer of wealth concentration in Vancouver’s upper class coupled with the lack of anything really to spend it on. Not that he was complaining. The more losers there were, the more opportunities for money making.

Daniel found a tight parking spot to shoved his corolla into, right between a black sedan and a concrete wall on the fourth floor. The screech of his tires drawing annoyed looks from nearby (drunk) patrons, but he paid them no mind. Unsurprisingly, the faces leaving the establishment were full of frustration and resignation, and he figured they were probably heading home to mope about their wasted money. 

Daniel hummed as he strode past them into the main lobby. He was like these losers once, but he’d been on a hot streak for a few weeks now, and things were looking up. Soon, he’d be able to pay off his debts, and get back to building his bankroll. Then, nothing would stand between him and greatness.

By the time he reached the poker room, he was pumped and ready to play. The room was packed like he suspected, and he recognized a few of the regulars amongst the players. Some of those faces turned sour when they saw him enter the room. One of them, a graying man Daniel vaguely remembered as James, muttered something bitter before leaving the table. Daniel smirked—poor James probably couldn’t handle another beating at his hands.

“Lucky you. Looks like a spot just opened up,” the floor manager said, turning to Daniel. “What’s your name again, sir?”

“Daniel Kang.”

“Alright Mr. Kang, please get your chips from the cashier and sit down at table 1.”

Daniel sauntered over to the cashier, his confidence radiating. He knew these people didn’t like him for winning all the time, but it wasn’t his fault they sucked. With chips in hand, he plopped into his seat at the table and plugged in his earphones, scrolling through NewTube until the blinds came around. The noise of the room faded into the background as he found a podcast discussing the 2025 stock market.

The host droned on about tech stocks, economic policies, and famous investors making their moves. Daniel was barely listening, but he still fantasized about the kind of money they were talking about. The details weren’t important—just the image of him, rich and untouchable, shutting up everyone who’d ever doubted him. His parents would have to eat their words. They’d finally see that he wasn’t a screw-up. And his girlfriend Mei? She’d stop her constant nagging once she realized he didn’t need her approval.

Before long, Daniel started playing. He folded a few hands to get a feel for the table. He casually observed the other players, letting his eyes linger on the small tells they didn’t realize they were giving away—the way one man adjusted his glasses when he was bluffing, or the tight grip on a woman’s chips whenever she had a strong hand. Opening frequencies and bluffing frequencies.

Eventually, Daniel began loosening up, playing more hands and letting his stack grow and fall at the mercy of lady luck. From the first few table rotations, he could feel that most of the other players wanted to avoid getting into a big pot with him, so he needed them to believe that he was leveraging his domineering image to get away with whatever two cards came his way. He was looking to push the older gentlemen around in particular, knowing that their pride would likely entice them into make emotional mistakes.

And then it happened.

He was holding a mediocre hand—queen-nine offsuit—but something about the guy across from him, a stocky man with a thick beard, felt... off. Daniel couldn’t put it into words, but there was a faint pressure in the air, a dull sensation like static in his chest. It always seemed to flare up when someone was nervous or trying too hard to act natural.

The bearded man re-raised to $150, causing the limpers in the table to grumble unhappily. To them, it was probably an easy fold. The man was known to only play premium hands, but Daniel just couldn’t shake the feeling he had, so he called. He was the only one that did.

The flop came down: queen of hearts, ten of clubs, two of diamonds. Top pair, weak kicker. Not exactly a hand to write home about. But as the bearded man raised, Daniel’s confidence grew. The man was overplaying his hand; Daniel could feel it. It wasn’t logic—just a faint sense of unease radiating from the guy, like a static charge building in the air.

Daniel called. The turn came: six of diamonds. Still top pair. The bearded man’s energy shifted—subtle, but noticeable. The dull pressure in Daniel’s chest lifted slightly, replaced by a nervous buzz. Daniel felt his own pulse quicken, but he forced himself to remain calm. When the man checked to him, Daniel checked back.

The river was a five of diamonds, completing the flush if the man was holding two diamonds, or a straight if the man was holding a three and a four. The bearded man hesitated for a fraction of a second before shoving his stack into the pot.

Daniel stared at the chips, his mind racing. The buzzing in his chest turned almost nauseating now, and he felt the man’s tension like a wave threatening to break. He couldn’t know for sure, but every instinct told him the man was bluffing.

“I call,” Daniel said, his voice calm.

The man slammed his cards down: king-jack offsuit. A complete bluff.

Daniel revealed his hand, and the dealer pushed the massive pile of chips toward him. The room went quiet for a moment, the kind of silence that only comes after a big win. Daniel tried to act nonchalant as he stacked his chips, but he could feel the eyes on him. Jealousy. Frustration. Resentment.

“That’s bullshit!” the bearded man snapped, standing up so fast his chair fell over. “I know you. You’ve been winning every damn hand this entire month! No one’s that lucky!”

“Yeah,” another player chimed in, glaring at Daniel. “You’re playing too perfect. What, you counting cards or something?”

Daniel shrugged, forcing a smirk as he leaned back in his chair, stacking his chips with deliberate slowness. “Maybe you guys just suck.”

The bearded man across the table slammed his fists on the table, rattling the chips and startling the dealer. “You think this is funny?” he growled, his voice rising above the noise of the poker room. “Nobody wins that much without cheating.”

Daniel’s smirk widened, infuriating the man further. “You’re just mad because I’m better than you,” he said, his tone dripping with condescension. “But hey, if you want me to explain how poker works, I charge by the hour.”

The bearded man’s face turned crimson, and he pointed a finger at Daniel. “You’re a goddamn cheat, and you know it! I should’ve known as soon as you walked in here.”

“Right,” Daniel said, standing up and pushing his chair back with a loud scrape. He towered over the table, his smirk now a sneer. “That’s why you’re broke, and I’m walking out with all your money. Because I’m the problem. Get real.”

The floor manager, sensing the tension about to boil over, stepped in quickly. “Gentlemen, let’s keep it civil. Mr. Kang, if you’re cashing out, the cage is over there.”

Daniel turned to the manager with an exaggerated shrug. “See? Even he knows I’m the only one here who isn’t a sore loser.”

He gathered his chips with deliberate flair, making sure to take his time stacking them as the other players glared daggers at him. The bearded man muttered something under his breath, but Daniel ignored it, tossing his earphones into his ears as he strolled toward the cashier with a self-satisfied smirk.

By the time he reached the parking lot, the smugness had begun to fade, replaced by a simmering annoyance. The rain had picked up even more, drumming on the pavement as he walked. He pulled his jacket tighter, hurrying toward his car, when his phone buzzed. He sighed, already knowing who it was before he answered.

“Yeah, Mei,” he said flatly, unlocking his car.

“Are you at the casino again?” Her tone was sharp, but there was an edge of worry behind it.

“Why do you always assume that?” he shot back, though he didn’t bother denying it.

“Because you’re always there!” she snapped. “Daniel, you said you’d cut back. Do you even hear yourself anymore? This isn’t healthy!”

“Healthy?” Daniel let out a bitter laugh. “You don’t get it, Mei. I’m winning. I’m making money. Or is that too hard for you to believe?”

“Until you don’t,” she said coldly. “You think this streak is going to last forever? You’re going to lose it all again, and then what? Crawl back to your parents?”

The mention of his parents made his blood boil. “Don’t you dare bring them into this,” he hissed, his grip tightening on the phone. “They… god, you’re just like them. Always nagging, always doubting. Fuck, it’s exhausting.”

“I’m trying to help you, Daniel,” she said, her voice softening. “This is getting out of control. If you won’t listen to me, I’ll—”

“You’ll what?” he cut her off, his voice rising. “Call my parents? Go ahead. Maybe they’ll finally have something to talk about at family dinners.”

“Daniel—”

He didn’t let her finish. “Stay the hell out of my business, Mei. You don’t know what you’re talking about.”

Before she could respond, he hung up and tossed the phone onto the passenger seat next to his cash winnings. For a moment, he just sat there, staring at the rain-soaked windshield, his breath coming in sharp, angry bursts.

“They’re all the same,” he muttered to himself, gripping the steering wheel. “They don’t get it. They don’t get me.”

With a growl of frustration, Daniel started the car and pulled out of the parking lot, the tires screeching on the rain-slicked pavement. His hands gripped the steering wheel tightly, the tension in his chest only fueling his resolve. There were other casinos, quieter ones where sore losers didn’t throw tantrums. Tonight wasn’t over—not by a long shot.

As he merged onto the main road, the storm intensified. Neon lights from nearby signs flickered in the puddles on the asphalt, fractured by the relentless rain. Daniel’s mind raced with plans to win bigger, to leave everyone in his dust. His chest tightened with a heady mix of determination and defiance. They didn’t get him. No one did.

But as he turned into the parking lot of another casino just a few blocks away, he noticed a familiar black sedan in his rearview mirror. Its headlights pierced through the downpour, the beam unwavering as it followed him into the lot. He frowned, brushing his thoughts away—plenty of cars were on the road tonight. It was nothing. Probably.

Parking near the entrance, Daniel killed the engine and reached for his wallet and money. The rhythmic drumming of rain against the roof was louder now, as if the storm itself had grown angrier. Shaking off his unease, he stepped out of the car, pulling his jacket tighter against the cold.

Then he saw it.

The black sedan rolled slowly into a spot just a few rows away, its windshield glistening with streaks of rain. It idled there, engine humming faintly. Daniel squinted, trying to make out the driver through the rain-streaked glass, but it was impossible. He swallowed hard, his stomach twisting.

He told himself it was a coincidence. Just someone else trying to wait out the storm. Still, his pace quickened as he splashed through shallow puddles, heading straight for the glowing casino entrance. Then came the sound—loud and unmistakable.

A car door slammed.

Daniel froze, the sound cutting through the rain like a gunshot. His breath hitched as he turned his head slightly, just enough to catch the shape of a shadowy figure stepping out of the sedan. It moved with purpose, its outline blurred by the downpour. The figure adjusted something at its side, then began walking toward him with deliberate, measured steps.

Daniel’s pulse thundered in his ears, and the icy grip of recognition closed around him like a vice. The bearded man from earlier.

“Hey!” the man barked, his voice gruff and angry. He was already closing the distance, his footsteps splashing in the rain. “You think you can just walk away after cheating us out of our money?”

Daniel didn’t wait for the confrontation. He bolted toward the lobby, the rain stinging his face as he sprinted. The glass doors were just ahead. If he could make it inside, security could—

A sharp, searing pain exploded in his side.

Daniel stumbled forward, his breath catching as his legs gave out beneath him. He hit the pavement hard, the wet surface soaking into his clothes. His hand flew to his side instinctively, and when he pulled it back, it was slick with blood.

“Cheaters like you don’t deserve to walk away,” the bearded man growled, standing over him with a blade in hand. His face twisted with a mix of rage and satisfaction. He reached down, yanking cash from Daniel’s pocket before patting him down for more.

Daniel’s vision blurred, the world around him tilting and spinning. He tried to speak, to shout for help, but only a weak gurgle escaped his lips. The man spat on the ground beside him before turning and walking away, his figure dissolving into the rain.

The pain was unbearable, radiating from his side in sharp, unrelenting waves. His thoughts grew fragmented, slipping away like the water pooling beneath him. He stared up at the stormy sky, the raindrops mixing with the warm blood spreading across his chest.

…Was this it?

Was this really all he was going to amount to?

Was he going to…

…

Bright lights swirled above him, and muffled voices cut through the haze.

“Severe internal injuries—stab wound to the abdomen.”

“Possible damage to the liver. BP is dropping fast. We need to stabilize him!”

Daniel’s consciousness flickered, fragments of the surgery room searing into his mind like a surreal fever dream. The sterile white lights blurred, and the voices faded into a distant hum. Somewhere deep in the void of his fading awareness, something stirred.

A faint glow emerged in the darkness, pulsing like a heartbeat. At first, it was warm and inviting, pulling Daniel toward it. But as he drifted closer, the glow began to shift, growing jagged and alien. Strange shapes coiled within it, abstract and incomprehensible, their edges writhing like shadows cast by an unseen fire.

Suddenly, he was falling—not through space, but through a dream of tangled memories. He saw flashes of tentacled forms moving through a black ocean, their sheer size and malevolence pressing down on him like a physical weight. A wave of suffocating sadness crashed over him, accompanied by the ghostly cries of people he didn’t recognize but somehow felt he should. Faces blurred together, their expressions twisted in agony before vanishing into the void.

In the final vision, the glow reformed into something towering and incomprehensible. A presence—not human, not even close—loomed over him. It had no face, only an endless depth of shifting patterns and eyes that seemed to look through him. Its silent gaze bore into his very being, and though it didn’t speak, he felt its judgment.

Then it was gone, and he was drowning in a single emotion that overpowered all others: regret.



[break]



Daniel jolted awake, his body drenched in sweat. His heart pounded against his ribs, the rhythmic beeping of the monitor grounding him in the present. The hospital room was unnervingly quiet, its fluorescent lights casting a harsh, sterile glow. His head throbbed as he struggled to orient himself, the faint scent of antiseptic filling his nostrils.

He flexed his trembling hands, staring at them as though they belonged to someone else. Something felt... wrong, like the world had shifted ever so slightly out of alignment. The dream—if that’s what it was—lingered in his mind, its vivid flashes of faceless beings, writhing tentacles, and suffocating despair haunting him like a specter. It felt too sharp, too tangible to be a product of his subconscious.

The door creaked open, breaking his spiraling thoughts. Daniel turned his head as a middle-aged doctor stepped inside, clipboard in hand. The man’s expression was calm but tinged with unease, his steps careful as he approached.

“Mr. Kang,” the doctor began, his voice steady but cautious. “How are you feeling?”

Daniel hesitated, his voice dry and raspy. “Like I got hit by a truck.”

The doctor offered a faint, practiced smile and pulled up a chair. “You’ve been through quite a lot,” he said, glancing at the clipboard. “The stab wound was severe. The blade pierced through your abdominal cavity, damaging your liver and intestines. You lost a significant amount of blood, and there were complications during surgery.”

Daniel frowned, his hand tightening around the thin hospital blanket. “Complications?” he echoed, his voice sharper than he intended.

The doctor nodded gravely. “We had to perform an emergency laparotomy to repair the damage. The liver is a particularly vascular organ, and controlling the bleeding was a challenge. You required multiple transfusions, and we had to resect a portion of your intestines. You’re stable now, but recovery will take time.”

Daniel exhaled slowly, his mind spinning. He opened his mouth to speak, then hesitated before asking, “What about the guy who stabbed me?”

The doctor paused, his expression tightening slightly. “I’m afraid I don’t have much information about that,” he admitted. “The hospital security team has been in contact with the authorities. The police will likely reach out to you soon for a statement.”

“That’s it?” Daniel pressed, his voice sharper than he intended. “You don’t know anything else?”

The doctor shook his head. “I’m sorry, Mr. Kang. I wish I had more to tell you.”

Daniel clenched his jaw, frustration bubbling beneath the surface. The image of the bearded man’s furious expression flashed in his mind, but he forced himself to push it aside.

“So... what happens now?” he asked finally, his voice subdued.

The doctor leaned forward slightly, his expression softening. “Our immediate priority is to monitor your condition and ensure there’s no further internal bleeding or infection. We’ll provide you with a nutrition plan to help you heal, as well as pain management and physical therapy. But...” His voice trailed off, and his eyes flicked to the clipboard.

Daniel’s chest tightened, a strange pressure building as the doctor hesitated. Something about the pause felt wrong, like the air itself had shifted. He didn’t know how, but he could feel the weight of the words forming before they were spoken.

“But during the scans,” the doctor continued cautiously, “we found something else.”

Daniel’s breath hitched, his pulse quickening. He seemed to recall something from his dream. “A mass,” he said softly, the word falling from his lips unbidden. He blinked, his own voice surprising him.

The doctor froze for a moment, his expression unreadable. “Yes,” he admitted, his tone quieter now. “A large mass in your liver. It’s advanced. Stage 4.”

The words hit Daniel like a punch to the gut, yet a strange sense of inevitability settled over him. He wasn’t shocked—not entirely. It was as if he’d already known, the truth lingering just beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered.

“I’m surprised you knew. Had you been diagnosed with this before?” the doctor asked, his tone both curious and concerned.

Daniel hesitated, his jaw tightening. “No,” he said, unwilling to offer more.

The doctor studied him carefully, his brow furrowing slightly. “I see… Well, I won’t sugarcoat this, Mr. Kang. During the scans, we found something else. The cancer has metastasized to other parts of your body—your lungs and lymph nodes, specifically.”

Daniel’s stomach sank. Metastasized. The word clanged in his mind, heavy and hollow.

“This type of cancer is usually caught earlier because it causes noticeable symptoms. The fact that you’ve made it this far without any is... unusual,” the doctor continued, his tone solemn. “I wish I had better news for you. There’s no cure at this stage, but there are treatments we can try. Chemotherapy and immunotherapy could slow the progression, and palliative care will help manage the symptoms and improve your quality of life…”

Daniel’s thoughts circled back to the words that had escaped his lips a moment ago. A mass. The cancer. He hadn’t just guessed—it had been there, like a certainty buried in his chest before the doctor had even spoken. How had he known? It wasn’t like he’d ever felt sick before. He hadn’t had so much as a persistent cough, let alone anything to make him suspect something so dire. And yet, the moment the doctor hesitated, Daniel had already known what was coming.

He thought back to the fragments of the dream that lingered like jagged shards in his mind. He couldn’t shake the vivid, terrifying images—the faceless beings, the suffocating void, the twisting shapes that defied comprehension. They weren’t just frightening; they felt meaningful in a way that made his skin crawl, as though they’d been trying to show him something.

Daniel clenched his fists, his breaths coming unevenly as he tried to make sense of it all. The knowledge of the cancer, the overwhelming regret, the surreal images—they felt connected, threads of a puzzle he couldn’t begin to piece together. His mind raced, searching for answers that refused to reveal themselves.

“Mr. Kang?”

The doctor’s voice broke through the fog, and Daniel blinked, his eyes snapping back to the sterile hospital room. The man was watching him, his expression a mix of concern and expectation.

“Do you agree to proceed with the treatment plan I’ve proposed?” the doctor repeated, his tone patient but firm. “We’ll begin with stabilizing your condition and administering palliative care to manage your symptoms. You’ll need to sign the consent forms.”

Daniel stared at the clipboard in the doctor’s hands, the weight of the dream pressing heavily on his chest. For a moment, he considered the pointlessness of it all—how the treatments wouldn’t really change anything. But he forced himself to nod, his movements mechanical. “Sure,” he muttered, taking the pen and scrawling his signature on the forms.

The doctor offered a faint smile, his demeanor professional yet distant. “We’ll do everything we can, Mr. Kang. The nurses will check in on you shortly.”

When the door clicked shut behind him, Daniel let out a shaky breath. His head sank back against the pillow, and he stared at the sterile white ceiling, his thoughts churning. The doctor’s words barely registered. What stuck with him was the dream—those creatures, those cries of anguish, that... thing. It felt less like a hallucination and more like a warning.

He turned his head to the side, catching sight of his phone on the bedside table. Reaching for it, he winced at the pain in his side but managed to grab it. The screen lit up with dozens of missed calls from Mei and a single unread text:

“Text me as soon as you get this.”

Daniel stared at the message, his thumb hovering over the screen. For the first time in a long while, he wasn’t angry or dismissive. Instead, he felt something else entirely: a creeping sense of shame. He really shouldn’t have yelled at her during their last phone call, much less defended his own gambling habits. But even this newfound realization couldn’t shake the undercurrent of unease that he was feeling.

The faint rhythmic beeping of the monitor filled the room as Daniel stared at the ceiling, lost in thought. His hand rested on the phone lying beside him, Mei’s message glowing faintly on the screen. Yet his mind wasn’t on her, or the pain radiating through his body, or even the doctor’s grim prognosis.

He had a feeling—no, a certainty—that someone was coming. Someone who wasn’t a nurse or doctor. Strangely, he felt… some degree of anticipation for this encounter.

The door creaked open, and Daniel turned his head slowly. A woman stepped inside, her heels clicking softly against the linoleum floor. She carried a slim leather folder in one hand and moved with the kind of composure that came only from years of practice. Her black pantsuit was perfectly tailored, her dark hair pulled back into a sleek bun. She looked like she’d stepped out of a corporate boardroom, not a hospital.

“Mr. Kang,” she said, her voice smooth and professional, her expression unreadable. “Good evening.”

Daniel didn’t react, his gaze steady as if he’d been expecting her. “Took you long enough.”

The woman stopped mid-step, a flicker of surprise crossing her face before she quickly masked it. “I wasn’t aware we were on a schedule,” she replied evenly, stepping closer to the bed. “My name is Janice Young. I represent Arkanis Biotech. We work with patients who find themselves in... complicated situations, much like yours.”

Daniel raised an eyebrow, leaning back slightly against the stiff pillows. “Complicated,” he repeated, his tone tinged with amusement. “That’s one way to put it.”

Janice’s lips quirked in a faint, polite smile that didn’t quite reach her eyes. “I understand your doctors have discussed the severity of your condition. Unfortunately, traditional treatment options don’t offer much hope. That’s where we come in.”

“Let me guess,” Daniel said, tilting his head. “You’re about to tell me there’s some miracle cure.”

“Not a cure,” Janice corrected smoothly. “An experimental procedure. Cutting-edge. Designed for cases like yours—advanced cancer, organ failure. It’s invasive, it’s risky, but for those who qualify, it’s a chance. A real one.”

Daniel’s smirk deepened, though it didn’t reach his eyes. “Sounds like a fairy tale. What’s the catch? There’s always a catch.”

Janice clasped her hands neatly over the folder, her expression not faltering for a second. “The procedure itself is costly, of course, and it’s still in the experimental stages. We offer it to select candidates in exchange for a ten-year work contract. You’d be working with Arkanis directly—compensated, of course—but tied to us. It ensures our investment is... mutually beneficial.”

Daniel’s laugh was soft but sharp. “A ten-year leash. Generous.”

“I assure you, Mr. Kang, Arkanis offers medical technologies that a hospital like this would never be able to provide you. This arrangement is quite favorable for our contractors. How important is your health to you?” Her words were precise, professional, but her gaze carried a subtle challenge, as though she was daring him to push further.

Daniel turned his head slightly, his eyes narrowing as he studied her. She was good—very good. Every word was measured, every expression carefully controlled. But there was something else beneath the surface, something she wasn’t saying. And Daniel, for reasons he couldn’t quite explain, knew it.

“Ok, I’ll do it,” he said abruptly.

Janice blinked, caught off guard for the first time. “You’ll... agree to the procedure, just like that?”

“On one condition.” Daniel’s smirk returned, sharper this time. “I want a tier 3 modification.”

The air in the room shifted. Janice’s polite smile faltered for a fraction of a second, her eyes narrowing imperceptibly. “I’m sorry, Mr. Kang,” she said, her voice still smooth but edged with caution. “I’m not sure what you mean.”

“Oh, come on,” Daniel said, waving a hand dismissively. “I know the procedure isn’t just about curing my cancer. I’m not interested in just surviving—I want to thrive. Tier 3, or no deal.”

Janice stared at him, her expression unreadable but her silence telling. Daniel could feel her weighing the situation, trying to decide whether to dismiss him, humor him, or interrogate him further.

“How do you know about the tiers?” she asked finally, her voice quieter but laced with steel.

Daniel shrugged, his gaze never leaving hers. “Let’s just say I’ve got my sources. Doesn’t really matter how I know, does it? What matters is that I do.”

Janice’s expression hardened, her composure cracking just enough to reveal the sharp edge beneath. “Do you realize how dangerous it is to be making demands like this? Especially when you shouldn’t even know what you’re talking about?”

Daniel leaned back against the pillow, his smirk widening. “You could kill me, sure. But then you’d lose out on a very good deal.”

Janice’s eyes narrowed further, her hand tightening slightly on the leather folder. “And what deal would that be?”

“You give me the tier 3 modification,” Daniel said, his tone casual but firm. “I go through your little tutorial, and I don’t just survive—I excel. You get to take the credit for my success, for bringing in a star candidate. I’m willing to bet that looks pretty damn good for you, doesn’t it?”

Janice studied him in silence, her gaze sharp and calculating. Daniel could feel her trying to read him, to pick apart his confidence and find the cracks. But he held steady, the faint static buzz in his chest giving him an edge he couldn’t quite explain.

Finally, she smiled again, but this time it didn’t reach her eyes. “You’re very bold, Mr. Kang. Boldness can be... useful. Or it can be fatal.”

“I’ll take my chances,” Daniel replied, his smirk unwavering. “But you’re smart enough to know a good opportunity when you see one. So, do we have a deal?”

Janice didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she closed the folder with a quiet snap and straightened her posture. “I’ll need to make some calls,” she said coolly. “In the meantime, I suggest you rest. You’ll need your strength.”

As she turned to leave, Daniel called after her, his voice laced with mock sincerity. “Looking forward to working with you, Ms. Young.”

She paused at the door, glancing back at him with an unreadable expression. Then she was gone, the sound of her heels fading into the hallway.

Daniel leaned back against the pillow, his smirk fading into a thoughtful frown. Whatever game he’d just stepped into, he knew one thing: he wasn’t playing by their rules. Not Janice Young, not Arkanis Biotech, not anyone.
