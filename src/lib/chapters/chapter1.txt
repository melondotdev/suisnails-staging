A bright light flashed and the sound of screeching tires cut through the pitter pattering of rain. For a moment, Daniel thought his world was coming to an end.

“It’s a four-way stop, asshole!” 

Daniel blinked in surprise before hot anger began bubbling up inside him. He rolled down his window, teeth bared in a snarl.

“Yeah, and I was here first. Screw you!” he spat back as loudly as he could.

The van in front of him drove off with a squeal, its driver throwing up a middle finger as a parting gift. Daniel shook his head in disgust. “Moron,” he muttered under his breath, gripping the steering wheel tightly.

This was why he hated driving in Vancouver—too many idiots who thought they knew better than everyone else. Combine that with the winter downpour and subzero temperatures, it was a perfect formula for the Vancouver special: an ice rink full of shitty skaters and guaranteed prognosis for some next-level ass clenching.

But Daniel wasn’t going to let a little rain—or some idiot in a van—ruin his night. Not when there was money to be made.

No one in their right mind should be out at 1 AM on a night like this. Even so, when he reached the casino, the parking lot was jam-packed—a symptom of Vancouver’s entitled wealthy class coupled with the lack of anything worthwhile to spend it on.

Not that he was complaining. The more losers there were tonight, the more opportunities to make money.

Daniel found a tight parking spot and shoved his Corolla into it, wedging between a sleek black sedan and a grimy concrete wall. His tires screeched, drawing annoyed looks from a group of drunk patrons nearby. He ignored them, stepping out into the rain and pulling his hoodie over his head. The icy droplets stung his skin, but his mind was already elsewhere.

Inside. Felt tables. Clinking chips. The thrill of the win.

On his way to the entrance, his eyes caught sight of a homeless man huddled against the wall. The man’s blanket was threadbare, barely clinging to his emaciated frame. A soggy cardboard sign rested in front of him, the ink running from the rain. It read, "Anything helps—God bless."

Daniel wrinkled his nose and kept walking.

“Spare some change?” the man rasped, his voice barely audible over the rain.

Daniel stopped, turning just enough to glance down at him. He patted his jacket pocket theatrically. “Sorry,” he said, smirking. “Fresh out of charity.”

The man’s gaze dropped, and Daniel kicked the sign as he passed, sending it skidding across the wet pavement. “Pick that up,” he muttered, shaking his head.

Near the entrance, a couple stumbled out of the casino. Their faces were pale, eyes glassy, their movements slow. They looked like they’d been gutted. Daniel smirked. He recognized that look—he’d worn it often enough in the past.

But not anymore.

He wasn’t one of the losers, not tonight. Not for the past few weeks. His hot streak had changed everything. He’d be able to pay off his debts soon, maybe even get ahead for once. The thrill of it all made his pulse quicken.

Inside the casino, the warmth hit him like a wall. The air smelled faintly of cigarettes and stale cologne, a cocktail of desperation and fleeting hope. He strode through the lobby and into the poker room, his eyes sweeping the tables.

The low hum of conversation, the shuffle of cards, the clatter of chips—it was music to his ears. He recognized a few regulars, their faces darkening when they saw him. One of them, an older man named James, glared at him as he gathered his remaining chips.

James muttered something under his breath as he stood, the weight of another bad night pulling at his shoulders. He didn’t look back as he left the table.

Daniel smirked and shook his head. “Guess some people just can’t take the heat,” he muttered to himself.

“Looks like a spot just opened up,” the floor manager said, stepping over. He was a wiry man in a cheap suit, his tone polite but businesslike. “What’s your name again, sir?”

“Kang,” he said. “Daniel Kang.”

“Alright, Mr. Kang,” the manager replied. “The cashier’s over there. Get your chips, and you can sit at table one.”

Daniel nodded and sauntered off toward the cashier, his confidence radiating with every step. The familiar thrill of anticipation buzzed in his chest as he exchanged cash for chips, the weight of them in his hands like a promise. Tonight, he told himself, was going to be his night. Again.

Sliding into his seat at the table, Daniel plugged in his earphones and scrolled through NewTube while waiting for the blinds to come around. The noise of the poker room—the shuffling of cards, the clatter of chips, the low hum of conversation—faded into the background as he found a podcast about the 2024 stock market.

The host droned on about tech stocks, economic policies, and famous investors hedging their bets. Daniel only half-listened, his mind wandering. The details didn’t matter to him, not really. What mattered was the vision in his head: him, rich and untouchable, proving everyone wrong.

His parents, who had written him off as a disappointment, would have to eat their words. They’d see he wasn’t a screw-up. And Mei? She’d stop nagging him about his choices once she saw how much money he could make.

The blinds finally came around, snapping Daniel back to the present. He folded a few hands at first, taking his time to get a feel for the table. His eyes lingered on the other players, noting their habits and quirks. One man adjusted his glasses every time he bluffed, while a woman’s fingers tightened around her chips whenever she had a strong hand. Easy reads. Easy money.

From the first few rotations, Daniel noticed something else: the other players were scared of him. They avoided getting into big pots with him, folding early or making cautious bets. He’d seen this before. His reputation preceded him, and not in a good way.

Daniel began loosening up, playing more hands and pushing the table harder. He bet aggressively, bluffed with confidence, and let his stack ebb and flow like a tide. His domineering image began to morph, becoming something less predictable, something calculated. To the untrained eye, he seemed reckless. But to those who paid attention—and Daniel knew how to make them pay attention—it was clear he was building a narrative. Every move was designed to bait the older players into emotional decisions, and one by one, they fell for it.

The chips piled up in front of him, and Daniel leaned back in his chair, stretching lazily as he surveyed the table. The tension was palpable. The players around him were either glaring at him openly or avoiding his gaze entirely.

“Man, you’re on a streak tonight,” one of the younger players said, shaking his head as Daniel raked in another pot. “Do you ever lose?”

“Not lately,” Daniel replied with a grin, stacking his chips methodically. “But I hear it happens. To other people.”

The younger player chuckled nervously, but the older players weren’t as amused. The bearded man across from him—stocky, red-faced, and clearly several drinks in—scowled.

“No one’s that lucky,” the man said, his voice rough with suspicion. “You’ve been winning every damn hand for weeks now. Either you’ve got a horseshoe up your ass, or you’re pulling something shady.”

Daniel’s grin widened as he leaned back in his chair, folding his arms behind his head. “Or maybe, just maybe,” he said, dragging out the words, “I’m better than you.”

The bearded man’s scowl deepened. “Better? Kid, you don’t know the first thing about poker. You’re just riding a streak. It’ll break, and when it does, you’ll be crawling out of here with your tail between your legs.”

Daniel’s smile faltered for a fraction of a second at the word kid, but he quickly recovered, leaning forward with a smirk that didn’t quite reach his eyes. “Kid, huh? That’s funny. Last I checked, I’m the one with all the chips. But sure, let’s pretend I don’t know what I’m doing.”

“You’re what? Twenty-five? Twenty-six?” another older player chimed in, his tone mocking. “You’re too young to be wasting your time here. Shouldn’t you be building a career or something? Doing something with your life?”

Daniel’s jaw tightened. “I’m twenty-nine,” he said sharply. “And what I do with my life is my business, not yours.”

“Relax, kid,” the bearded man said with a grin that didn’t hide his condescension. “We’re just saying—this isn’t the place to be chasing dreams. Poker’s a game. It’s not a life.”

Daniel’s voice dropped, low and cold. “You think I’m here for fun?” He gestured to the pile of chips in front of him. “This isn’t a game to me. This is work. And I’m good at it.”

“Good at gambling,” the younger player muttered under his breath.

Daniel snapped his gaze to him, his smile vanishing entirely. “Gambling?” he repeated, his voice sharp. “You think this is gambling? This is strategy. This is reading people, playing the odds, making calculated risks. It’s no different from investing in the stock market.”

The bearded man barked a laugh. “Stock market? You mean the thing that’s been screwing people over for decades? Yeah, real stable career choice there.”

Daniel’s hands clenched into fists under the table. “It’s the economy that’s screwed, not me. Jobs that don’t pay enough to cover rent, student loans that bury you alive, and a housing market that’s a joke. But sure, yeah, let’s all just ‘work harder’ and pretend that fixes everything.”

The older players exchanged glances, their amusement fading. The bearded man leaned forward, his eyes narrowing. “Sounds like a lot of excuses, kid. Maybe the problem isn’t the system. Maybe it’s you.”

Daniel’s smirk returned, colder this time. “Maybe you’re just mad that someone younger than you is outplaying you at your own game.”

The tension around the table thickened, but Daniel didn’t care. Let them be mad. Let them stew in their own frustration. He thrived on it.

And then it happened.

He was holding queen-nine offsuit—mediocre at best—but something about the bearded man’s energy changed. Daniel couldn’t explain it, but there was a faint pressure in the air, a static charge that made his chest tighten. The man had re-raised to $150, and the table groaned in frustration, folding one by one. Daniel, though, couldn’t shake the feeling that the man was bluffing.

He called, ignoring the way the older players exchanged knowing glances.

The flop came down: queen of hearts, ten of clubs, two of diamonds. Top pair, weak kicker. Nothing extraordinary. But the pressure in Daniel’s chest intensified. The bearded man raised again, his movements sharp, almost aggressive. Daniel called without hesitation.

The turn brought a six of diamonds. The bearded man hesitated, his energy shifting ever so slightly. He checked, and Daniel checked back, the static buzz in his chest growing louder.

The river was a five of diamonds, completing a flush or straight for anyone holding the right cards. The bearded man shoved his stack into the pot without blinking.

Daniel stared at the chips, the buzz in his chest almost nauseating now. He didn’t know why he knew, but he knew. The man was bluffing.

“I call,” Daniel said, his voice steady.

The bearded man slammed his cards down: king-jack offsuit. Nothing.

Daniel revealed his hand, and the dealer pushed the massive pile of chips toward him. The table went silent, the kind of silence that only comes after a big win.

“That’s bullshit!” the bearded man snapped, standing so fast his chair tipped over. “You’ve been cheating all night! Nobody wins that much!”

“Yeah,” another player chimed in, his glare sharp. “You’re too perfect. What, you counting cards or something?”

Daniel shrugged, smirking as he stacked his chips with deliberate slowness. “I’m just playing the way the game’s supposed to be played.”

The bearded man’s fists slammed onto the table, rattling the chips. “You think this is funny? You’re a goddamn cheat, and you know it!”

Daniel stood, towering over the table with a sneer. “You’re just mad because I’m better than you. But hey, if you want me to teach you how poker works, I charge by the hour.”

The floor manager, sensing the tension about to boil over, stepped in quickly. “Gentlemen, let’s keep it civil. Mr. Kang, if you’re cashing out, the cage is over there.”

Daniel turned to the manager with an exaggerated shrug. “See? Even he knows I’m the only one here who isn’t a sore loser.”

He gathered his chips with deliberate flair, making sure to take his time stacking them as the other players glared daggers at him. The bearded man muttered something under his breath, but Daniel ignored it, tossing his earphones into his ears as he strolled toward the cashier with a self-satisfied smirk.

Not a long play session today, but it couldn’t be helped, Daniel supposed. He still came out with a hefty profit yet again. He felt absolutely unstoppable.

By the time Daniel reached the parking lot, the smugness that had carried him through the poker room began to fade, replaced by a familiar itch crawling beneath his skin—the craving for another hand, another win. He considered turning back, lingering on the thought for a brief moment. The image of raking in another stack of chips teased him, but he shook his head. No, better to lay low for now. Too many eyes on him tonight. He’d come back when the heat had died down.

The rain had picked up, drumming relentlessly on the pavement as he walked toward his car. He pulled his jacket tighter, the icy droplets stinging his face. Just as he unlocked his car, his phone buzzed in his pocket.

He sighed, already knowing who it was. “Yeah, Mei,” he said flatly, answering the call as he slid into the driver’s seat.

“Are you at the casino again?” Her tone was sharp, but there was an unmistakable undercurrent of worry.

“Why do you always assume that?” he snapped back, though he made no effort to deny it.

“Because you’re always there!” she shot back, her voice rising. “Daniel, you promised me. You said you’d cut back. Do you even hear yourself anymore? This isn’t healthy.”

“Healthy?” Daniel let out a bitter laugh, tossing his wet hood back and gripping the steering wheel with his free hand. “You don’t get it, Mei. I’m winning. I’m making money. Isn’t that what you’re always on about? Stability? Planning for the future? Well, guess what? That’s what I’m doing. Or is that too hard for you to believe?”

“Until you don’t,” Mei snapped, cutting through his tirade. “You think this streak is going to last forever? You’re going to lose it all again, Daniel, and then what? Crawl back to your parents like always?”

The mention of his parents was like a spark to dry tinder. His grip on the phone tightened, his knuckles turning white. “Don’t you dare bring them into this,” he hissed, his voice dangerously low. “You don’t know the first thing about what I’ve been through with them. They’ve never believed in me, just like you. All they do is nag and doubt and drag me down. God, you’re just like them.”

“I’m trying to help you, Daniel,” Mei said, her voice softer now, but the edge of frustration still lingered. “I’m worried about you. This isn’t normal. This isn’t sustainable. If you won’t listen to me, then—”

“Then what?” he cut her off, his voice rising. “You’ll call them? Go ahead. Maybe they’ll finally have something to talk about at one of their precious family dinners.”

“Daniel—”

“No, Mei,” he snapped, cutting her off again. His chest heaved with anger, and his words came out in a torrent. “You don’t get it. Nobody does. You think you’re so high and mighty, looking down on me like I’m some kind of screw-up. But you have no idea what it’s like—trying to make something of yourself when everyone expects you to fail. I don’t need your lectures, and I sure as hell don’t need you meddling in my life.”

“Daniel,” Mei tried again, her voice cracking now, but he didn’t let her finish.

“Stay the hell out of my business, Mei. You don’t know what you’re talking about.” Without waiting for her response, he ended the call, slamming the phone onto the passenger seat next to his winnings.

For a moment, he just sat there, staring through the rain-streaked windshield, his breath coming in short, angry bursts. The sound of the storm pounding against the car filled the silence, but it did nothing to calm the rage boiling inside him.

“They’re all the same,” he muttered, his hands gripping the steering wheel so tightly his knuckles ached. “Always doubting me. Always acting like they know what’s best for me. They don’t get it. They don’t get me.”

He started the car with a growl of frustration, the engine roaring to life as he backed out of the parking lot. The tires screeched on the rain-slicked pavement, the noise echoing sharply in the empty structure. He didn’t care if he drew attention. Let them hear him. Let them see him leave with their money.

His hands stayed clenched on the wheel as he pulled onto the main road, his mind racing with a mix of anger and defiance. There were other casinos, quieter ones where he wouldn’t have to deal with sore losers or meddling floor managers. He’d stayed away from those spots to avoid spreading himself too thin, but tonight? Tonight wasn’t over—not by a long shot.

As he merged onto the main road, the storm intensified. Neon lights from nearby signs flickered in the puddles on the asphalt, fractured by the relentless rain. Daniel’s mind raced with plans to win bigger, to leave everyone in his dust. His chest tightened with a heady mix of determination and defiance. They didn’t get him. No one did.

But as he turned into the parking lot of the next casino just a few miles away, he noticed a familiar black sedan in his rearview mirror. Its headlights pierced through the downpour, the beam unwavering as it followed him into the lot. He frowned, brushing his thoughts away—plenty of cars were on the road tonight. It was nothing. Probably.

Parking near the entrance, Daniel killed the engine and reached for his wallet. The rhythmic drumming of rain against the roof was louder now, as if the storm itself had grown angrier. Shaking off his unease, he stepped out of the car, pulling his jacket tighter against the cold.

Then he saw it.

The black sedan rolled slowly into a spot just a few rows away, its windshield glistening with streaks of rain. It idled there, engine humming faintly. Daniel squinted, trying to make out the driver through the rain-streaked glass, but it was impossible. He swallowed hard, his stomach twisting.

He told himself it was a coincidence. Just someone else trying to wait out the storm. Still, his pace quickened as he splashed through shallow puddles, heading straight for the glowing casino entrance. Then came the sound—loud and unmistakable.

A car door slammed.

Daniel froze, the sound cutting through the rain like a gunshot. His breath hitched as he turned his head slightly, just enough to catch the shape of a shadowy figure stepping out of the sedan. It moved with purpose, its outline blurred by the downpour. The figure adjusted something at its side, then began walking toward him with deliberate, measured steps.

Daniel’s pulse thundered in his ears, and the icy grip of recognition closed around him like a vice. The bearded man from earlier.

“Hey!” the man barked, his voice gruff and angry. He was already closing the distance, his footsteps splashing in the rain. “You think you can just walk away after cheating me out of my money?”

Daniel didn’t wait for the confrontation. He bolted toward the lobby, the rain stinging his face as he sprinted. The glass doors were just ahead. If he could make it inside, security could—

A sharp, searing pain exploded in his side.

Daniel stumbled forward, his breath catching as his legs gave out beneath him. He hit the pavement hard, the wet surface soaking into his clothes. His hand flew to his side instinctively, and when he pulled it back, it was slick with blood.

“Cheaters like you don’t deserve to walk away,” the bearded man growled, standing over him with a blade in hand. His face twisted with a mix of rage and satisfaction. He reached down, yanking cash from Daniel’s pocket before patting him down for more.

Daniel’s vision blurred, the world around him tilting and spinning. He tried to speak, to shout for help, but only a weak gurgle escaped his lips. The man spat on the ground beside him before turning and walking away, his figure dissolving into the rain.

The pain was unbearable, radiating from his side in sharp, unrelenting waves. His thoughts grew fragmented, slipping away like the water pooling beneath him. He stared up at the stormy sky, the raindrops mixing with the warm blood spreading across his chest.

…Was this it?

Was this really all he was going to amount to?

Was he going to…

…
