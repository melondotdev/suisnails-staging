Muted voices cut through the haze like distant echoes above Daniel.

“Abdominal stab wound—just missed the liver.”

“Vitals are stable, but let’s check for internal bleeding.”

The sterile voices wavered, dipping into and out of clarity as his consciousness flickered like a faulty bulb. His awareness floated in fragments—blurred faces, the harsh glare of surgical lights, the cold bite of metal tools against flesh. Somewhere beyond the fog, something stirred. A faint glow pulsed within the darkness of his mind, warm and inviting at first, but it soon warped, growing jagged and alien.

Strange shapes coiled in the glow, abstract and unknowable. They writhed with the distorted grace of shadows cast by a flickering fire. He drifted toward them, unmoored and weightless, until the vision shattered into flashes of tentacles breaching an infinite black ocean. Waves of suffocating sorrow and distant, ghostly cries pulled him under, twisting his memories into a maelstrom of faces he couldn’t name. Their anguish clung to him, dragging him deeper.

Then, amidst the chaos, a presence emerged—towering, incomprehensible, and infinite. It loomed with shifting patterns of depthless eyes and silence heavy with judgment. Its wordless gaze pierced through Daniel, hollowing him out. The judgment echoed.

YOU SHOULD NOT EXIST.


- break -


Daniel jolted awake, his breath catching as his chest heaved. Sweat clung to his body, and the rhythmic beeping of a monitor became the only thing tethering him to reality. The dim hospital room swam into focus, bathed in sterile fluorescent light, while the faint scent of antiseptic filled his nostrils.

His heart pounded, not just from the memory of the stabbing or the pain in his side, but from something else—something deeper, gnawing at him like a predator in the dark. His chest felt tight, his pulse erratic. 

GET READY.

The thought came unbidden, sharp and insistent.

For what? He didn’t know. But the urgency consumed him, its intensity growing with every beat of his racing heart. It was maddening, like trying to hold onto a fleeting dream as it slipped through his fingers. There was something just out of reach—a memory, or perhaps a warning—twisting and writhing in the edges of his mind.

His wound throbbed, yanking him back to the present. He gingerly lifted his hospital gown, revealing the clean white bandages that covered his abdomen. A flash of clarity cut through the haze: he’d been stabbed. The bearded man. The rain. The blade. The memory was painfully clear, but it felt incomplete, as though it were only one piece of a much larger puzzle.

The door creaked open, pulling him out of his spiraling thoughts. Daniel flinched, his heart leaping as a middle-aged doctor stepped inside, clipboard in hand. The man had ginger hair and a trimmed beard, his calm demeanor betraying no urgency. For a moment, Daniel envied him.

“Mr. Kang,” the doctor greeted, his voice steady and tinged with a Scottish accent. “Good to see you awake.”

Daniel swallowed hard, his throat dry and scratchy. “Where... how long was I out?”

“Two days,” the doctor replied, glancing at his notes. “You’ve been through quite the ordeal. How are you feeling?”

Daniel hesitated, his mind still racing with fragmented thoughts. “Like I got stabbed,” he said finally, his voice rasping. A dry chuckle escaped him, though it sent a sharp jolt of pain through his side. He winced, clutching the blanket.

The doctor nodded, offering a faint smile. “Well, you’re lucky. The blade missed any major organs. There’s tissue damage, and you’ve had a transfusion for blood loss, but nothing life-threatening. Take it easy for a while, though. Laughing’s off the table.”

Daniel managed a weak smile, but something about the doctor’s demeanor gnawed at him. There was an odd precision to the man’s words, his movements almost too measured. It wasn’t comforting—it was clinical, detached in a way that made Daniel’s skin crawl.

As the doctor flipped through his clipboard, Daniel’s eyes flicked to the badge clipped to his coat. It read Dr. Alan Royce, Arkfield Hospital.

Arkfield.

The name sent a chill down Daniel’s spine. He didn’t know why, but the word felt wrong, ominous, like a half-remembered nightmare clawing its way back to him. He couldn’t place it, yet the very sound of it tightened the knot in his stomach. He certainly didn’t remember hearing about an Arkfield Hospital in Vancouver…

“Is there anyone you’d like us to contact for you?” the doctor asked, his voice breaking through Daniel’s thoughts. “We didn’t find any emergency contacts on your record.”

The question caught Daniel off guard. Who would come? His family? They wouldn’t attend his funeral, much less visit him at the hospital. And Mei... his stomach churned. The guilt from their last argument sat heavy in his chest, pressing down like a weight he couldn’t shake.

Her voice echoed in his mind, sharp and frustrated:

"You need to stop this, Daniel. The gambling, the debts—it’s going to destroy you."

"I’ve got it under control," he’d snapped back, his tone cutting like a knife.

"Under control?" Her laugh had been bitter, hollow. "You’ve said that before. You always say that, and then it gets worse."

He’d brushed her off, hung up on her before she could say anything else. At the time, it felt justified. She didn’t understand what he was going through—no one did. But now, lying in a hospital bed with a stab wound to his gut, it all felt different. The weight of that last conversation bore down on him.

I need to save her.

The thought hit him out of nowhere, fierce and consuming. He gripped the blanket tightly, his chest tightening as the memory tangled with the surreal urgency clawing at his mind. Save her? From what? Herself? Him? He didn’t know, but the feeling was undeniable. He needed to do something—anything—but the specifics slipped away the moment he tried to grasp them.

“Mr. Kang?” the doctor asked, his voice tinged with concern. “Are you feeling alright?”

“No,” Daniel said quickly, the word coming out sharper than intended. “I mean yes, I’m alright. You don’t need to contact anyone for me. I’ll... I’ll do it myself later.”

The doctor raised an eyebrow but didn’t press further. “Understood,” he said simply, handing Daniel a glass of water. “Drink this. I’ll have the nurse bring you a meal soon. Rest is your priority. Let’s keep a close eye on your recovery, alright?”

The door clicked shut as the doctor left, leaving Daniel alone with his thoughts. He stared at the ceiling, his hand resting on the bandages that covered his side. The stabbing was real—painfully, obviously real—but everything else felt... off. The dream, if he could call it that, clung to him like a shadow. Writhing shapes. Piercing eyes. Suffocating despair. And the name Arkfield sat heavy in his mind, like a shard of glass stuck just beneath the surface.

He couldn’t shake the feeling that something was wrong. Very wrong.

Grimacing through the pain, Daniel put the cup of water down on the bedside table and swung his legs over the side of the bed. Every movement sent a jolt of protest through his body, but he ignored it. He didn’t know what he was looking for—didn’t even know if there was anything to find—but the gnawing urgency wouldn’t let him rest.

The room was sparse, clinical, but Daniel’s eyes scanned every corner as if it held answers. The cabinets. The drawers. Even the waste bin. He dragged himself to the counter, his fingers fumbling through neatly stacked supplies. Gauze, gloves, syringes—nothing unusual. But still, that itch at the back of his mind persisted, louder now.

He paused, his hand trembling as it hovered over a drawer. His pulse quickened. For a moment, he hesitated, unsure of whether he even wanted to know what was behind it. But the thought I need to get ready roared through his mind, and he pulled it open.

Empty.

Daniel let out a frustrated breath, his hand gripping the edge of the counter for support as his side throbbed in protest. He felt foolish, ridiculous even. What was he doing? Digging through drawers like he was going to find the meaning of life tucked away in a supply cabinet?

He might as well check his phone to see if anyone had contacted him while he was out. That was when a new thought struck him: Where are my things?

Hospitals usually returned personal belongings, didn’t they? His phone, his wallet—those should have been left in the room. Unless his assailant had taken them, someone would have had to account for them. And if they didn’t have his ID, how did they even know his name?

The knot of dread in his stomach tightened. He looked around the room again, more urgently this time, but there was no sign of his belongings. No bag. No personal effects. It didn’t make sense.

His hand drifted to his side, brushing against the bandage. The sharp sting made him wince, and for a moment, he considered lying back down. But as his fingers traced the edges of the dressing, something didn’t feel right. His mind raced back to the attack—the blade, the searing pain in his back. Not his side.

His breath caught. That wasn’t right. He clearly remembered the knife going into his back, the sickening sensation of it cutting through muscle and flesh. But now his side ached, and his back felt... fine.

Heart pounding, Daniel grabbed the edge of the bandage and ripped it away with a sharp tug. Pain flared, but he barely noticed as he stared at his exposed skin.

Nothing.

His side was unmarked. Smooth. There wasn’t even a scratch, much less a wound. His fingers flew to his back, searching desperately for the spot where the knife had gone in. But that too was smooth. Unscarred.

His heart raced, the ache in his side throbbing as if in defiance of the evidence before him. This doesn’t make sense, he thought, his breathing growing shallow. He pressed against his ribs, then his abdomen, trying to locate the source of the pain, but there was nothing—no swelling, no bruising, no sign of trauma.

“What the hell is going on?” he muttered, his voice trembling. Was his memory playing tricks on him? Had he imagined the attack? No. The memory was too vivid to be false. He could still feel the cold rain, hear the man’s angry voice, and see the flash of the blade.

But then... why was there no wound?

The urgency in his chest swelled, growing louder, more insistent. Get out, it seemed to say. You need to leave. Now.

Daniel staggered back to the bed, his legs weak and unsteady. He grabbed the hospital gown draped over the chair and slipped it on, tying it loosely in the back. The dull ache in his side hadn’t gone away, even though there was no physical reason for it. Every step sent a jolt through his body, but he pushed forward, his mind racing with questions.

The hallway beyond the door was eerily quiet, bathed in dim, flickering light. No nurses, no doctors, no patients. Just an empty stretch of sterile tile and shadowy corners.

Daniel hesitated for only a moment before stepping out. The air was thick and rancid, carrying a faint metallic tang that made his stomach churn. He glanced back at the door he’d just left, a small part of him tempted to return, but the gnawing urgency in his chest refused to let him stop.

This isn’t right. This isn’t normal.

He moved carefully, his bare feet padding silently against the cold tile. The dull ache in his side persisted, but he gritted his teeth and pressed on. As he passed the first room, he peered through the small window set into the door. Empty. The bed was neatly made, the machines powered down. He tried the next one—same thing.

Room after room, the story was the same. No patients. No people at all. Just cold, sterile emptiness.

Daniel’s unease grew with every step. He paused at the end of the hall, his breath catching as he spotted a window that looked out into the world. He approached it cautiously, his hand trembling as he reached out to wipe at the glass. It didn’t help. A thick, swirling fog clung to the pane, obscuring everything beyond.

He frowned, leaning closer. The fog seemed almost alive, shifting and writhing like it had a mind of its own. He pressed his forehead against the cool glass, trying to make out any landmarks, anything that would tell him where he was. But there was nothing—just an endless sea of grey.

“Where the hell am I?” he whispered. Am I even still in Vancouver?

The thought sent a chill down his spine. He backed away from the window, his pulse quickening. This wasn’t just a weird hospital. Something was deeply, fundamentally wrong here.

As he turned, a faint sound reached his ears—a wet, squelching noise, like something heavy being dragged across the floor. He froze, his breath hitching. The sound grew louder, coming from the intersection ahead. Slowly, carefully, Daniel crept toward the corner, his back pressed against the wall.

He peeked around the edge, his heart hammering in his chest.

At first, he didn’t see anything. The hallway ahead appeared empty, the lights flickering intermittently. But as he strained his eyes, something shifted. A faint shimmer rippled through the air, distorting the tiles and walls behind it. Daniel squinted, and his stomach dropped.

It was enormous, its body undulating with a slow, deliberate grace. The creature was nearly the length of the hallway, its slimy, translucent skin blending seamlessly with its surroundings. It moved like a predator, its massive bulk silent except for the occasional squelch as it slid forward.

Daniel’s throat tightened as recognition hit him. He’d seen something like this before, during a visit to the Vancouver Aquarium—a giant sea slug, its grotesque, alien form both mesmerizing and horrifying. But this one was far larger than anything he’d seen in captivity, and it shouldn’t have been here. It shouldn’t have been anywhere.

The creature paused, its body rippling as it shifted its weight. Daniel pressed himself against the wall, his breathing shallow. Its head—or what he assumed was its head—tilted slightly, the faint shimmer intensifying. It was camouflaged perfectly, blending so well with the hall that it was nearly invisible. If not for the way the light distorted around it, he would’ve walked right into it.

It doesn’t see me. Not yet.

His heart thundered in his chest as he inched backward, keeping his movements slow and deliberate. The creature undulated again, its form shimmering as it moved toward the opposite hall. Daniel clenched his fists, willing himself to stay calm. He couldn’t run. Not like this.

The creature paused, its head turning slightly in his direction. His breath hitched, and he ducked into the nearest room, closing the door as quietly as he could. His chest heaved as he pressed his back against the cool metal, his trembling hand gripping the handle to keep it shut. 

After what seemed like an eternity, the wet squelching sound faded, growing distant until it disappeared entirely. He exhaled shakily, his knees nearly buckling beneath him. The dim light of the supply room cast long shadows over shelves lined with medical supplies—gauze, syringes, glass bottles of clear liquid. The room smelled of alcohol and antiseptic, sharp and acrid.

For a brief moment, he allowed himself to relax, his head leaning back against the door. But the ache in his side flared up again, sharper this time, as if to remind him that he wasn’t safe. Not yet.

Daniel ran a hand through his damp hair, his thoughts spiraling. “A giant sea slug... hiding in a hospital? Camouflaged like a goddamn monster in a horror movie? What the hell is this place? Some kind of... experiment? A freak show?”

His side throbbed again, and he hissed through gritted teeth, pressing a hand to his abdomen. “And this...” He glanced down, half-expecting to see blood or stitches, but his skin was unblemished. Smooth. Too smooth.

“Did they... do something to me?” The words tasted foreign in his mouth, absurd even as he said them aloud. He shook his head, trying to banish the thought, but it lingered, gnawing at the edges of his mind.

“Get it together, Daniel,” he muttered, his voice trembling as he tried to steady his breathing. “First, I get stabbed. Then, I wake up in some... nightmare hospital. Now this? This can’t be real.” He clenched his fists, the broom creaking under his grip. “It can’t be.”

Click. Click-click. Click.

Daniel froze.

The sound was faint, almost like a broken metronome, repeating with eerie precision. His eyes darted around the room, searching for its source. It wasn’t coming from outside—it was here, inside the supply room with him.

Click. Click-click. Click.

The noise grew louder, more deliberate, and Daniel’s gaze locked onto the slightly ajar door of a storage closet. Shadows writhed within, and the faint rhythmic clicking made his skin crawl.

He tightened his grip on the nearest thing within reach—a long, wooden broom leaning against the wall. Its handle was cold and sturdy in his grasp, but it felt pitifully inadequate against whatever might be lurking behind that door.

“Hello?” he whispered hoarsely, his voice barely audible.

The clicking stopped.

His breath hitched, and the room seemed to close in around him. He took a cautious step forward, the ache in his side screaming in protest. The door to the closet shifted slightly, creaking open just enough for something to slip through.

It emerged slowly, its jerky, unnatural movements sending a chill down Daniel’s spine. The creature was humanoid, but only barely. Its limbs were elongated and spindly, its blue-green skin slick and glistening like it had just crawled out of the ocean. Its bulbous, cephalopod-like head twitched unnervingly, and its glassy, lidless eyes locked onto Daniel.

Click. Click-click. Click.

The sound came from deep within its throat, reverberating in a way that made Daniel’s stomach churn. He raised the broom instinctively, his hands trembling.

The creature coiled, its body tensing like a spring. Daniel’s instincts screamed at him to run, but before he could act, it lunged.

Time seemed to slow. A strange sensation washed over Daniel, cold and electric, numbing his fear. His movements became fluid, almost mechanical, as if someone else had taken control of his body. Without thinking, he swung the broom with all his strength. The handle connected with a sickening crack, sending the creature sprawling back into the closet.

It screeched, a high-pitched, guttural noise that rattled in Daniel’s ears. He didn’t stop. He snapped the broom over his knee, the sharp ends of the broken handle splintering into crude weapons. His grip on the jagged pieces was firm, instinctive. He stepped forward, his body moving with an expert precision he didn’t recognize.

The creature writhed and lashed out, its limbs flailing wildly, but Daniel sidestepped its attack with a grace that felt entirely foreign. He drove the sharp end of the broom handle into its torso. The creature shrieked, its body convulsing as dark, briny fluid oozed from the wound.

It lashed out again, its claws raking the air, but Daniel anticipated the movement, ducking under its arm and stabbing it again. This time, the creature collapsed, its twitching slowing until it lay still.

The moment the fight ended, the trance-like state shattered. Daniel stumbled back, the jagged broom handle clattering to the floor. His chest heaved, and a searing pain flared in his side, radiating through his body like a hot iron pressed against his ribs. He clutched at his abdomen, his knees buckling as he leaned heavily against the counter.

His vision blurred, dark spots swimming in his periphery. For a moment, he thought he might pass out. The creature’s body lay crumpled in the closet, its twisted form leaking dark, briny fluid that pooled on the tile. The stench hit him like a wave—salt, rot, and something chemical that made his stomach churn violently.

“What the hell?” he whispered, his voice barely audible over the sound of his ragged breathing. The ache in his side throbbed mercilessly, each pulse making his nausea worse. Before he could stop it, the bile rose in his throat.

Daniel lurched forward, vomiting onto the floor beside the counter. The heaving left him gasping for air, his entire body trembling as he wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. The metallic tang of bile lingered, mixing with the rancid smell of the room.

He spat to clear his mouth, his free hand gripping the counter for support. “Great,” he muttered weakly. “Now I’m fighting monsters and puking on hospital floors. Really winning today.”

The words rang hollow in the heavy air, but they gave him something to latch onto—something human. He sagged against the counter, his knees trembling as his thoughts raced. How had he done that? His mind replayed the fight in stuttering fragments: the way his body had moved, smooth and precise, like it wasn’t even his. His hands, blistered and shaking now, had wielded the broken broom like a weapon, striking with the kind of efficiency he’d only ever seen in movies.

But that wasn’t him. It couldn’t be him.

Daniel swallowed hard, the bile still sour on his tongue as he straightened slowly. He wasn’t a fighter. He’d never been in so much as a schoolyard scuffle, let alone anything like this. And yet… he had moved like someone who knew exactly what they were doing. Anticipating the creature’s attacks. Exploiting its openings. It was like his body had been running on instinct—instinct that didn’t belong to him.

His thoughts shifted to the doctor—the too-precise man with his clipped words and steady, clinical gaze. What had he done to him? Daniel had barely been conscious during their brief interaction, but there was something unsettling about the man. Something cold. Detached.

Daniel’s stomach churned, a cold knot of unease forming in his gut. Had the doctor done something to him? Injected him with something? Altered him in some way? He couldn’t shake the memory of the man’s face, impassive and unreadable, as if he were observing a lab rat instead of a patient.

“Shit,” Daniel muttered, running a shaky hand through his damp hair. He needed answers, but there was no one here to give them. Just him, the clicking monsters, and whatever else lurked in the shadows of this godforsaken place.

He bent down slowly, grimacing as his side protested, and picked up the two broken halves of the broom. The makeshift weapons felt oddly comforting in his hands, a small shred of security in a situation spiraling far beyond his control. He stood upright, his breathing still uneven, and glanced toward the door.

“Any other bloody monsters want a piece of me?” he muttered, his voice tinged with a shaky bravado he didn’t feel. He peered out into the hallway, his heart hammering. The corridor stretched out, empty and silent save for the occasional flicker of the overhead lights.

The coast was clear—for now.

Daniel stepped into the hallway cautiously, the pieces of the broom held tightly in either hand. His muscles screamed with every movement, but he pushed forward, his instincts telling him to keep going. He reached the end of the corridor, spotting an elevator at the far wall. Relief flickered through him.

He pressed the call button. Nothing happened.

“Of course,” he muttered, jamming the button repeatedly as if that would make a difference. A faint hum came from the elevator shaft, but the doors didn’t budge. He swore under his breath and turned his attention to the stairwell door beside it.

The metal handle was cold and slick in his grip as he pulled the door open. A wave of damp, stagnant air hit him immediately, making his nose wrinkle. The stairwell was dimly lit, the fluorescent lights flickering weakly. A “7” on the wall told him that he was on the seventh floor of the hospital.

Though instinctively he wanted to go down, water glistened on the steps leading to the floor below pooling at the bottom of the landing and disappearing into the darkness below.

He leaned over the railing, peering down into the abyss. The water had flooded everything below the seventh floor, rising almost to the landing where he stood. A faint ripple disturbed the surface, sending a shiver down his spine. He had no idea what could be down there, but he had no intention of finding out.

Part of him considered going back to his original hospital room. He could wait there for the doctor to return, let someone—anyone—explain what the hell was going on.

The thought lingered for only a moment before he shook his head violently. No. Whatever this place was, he couldn’t trust it. The doctor, the hospital, the creatures—none of it made sense, and none of it felt safe.

Daniel tightened his grip on the broken broom handles, his jaw set. He couldn’t go down—the stairwell was flooded, the water below rippling with who-knew-what lurking beneath. That left only one option: up.

The stairwell was quiet, save for the faint sound of dripping water. The air was damp and cold, the metal railing slick under his trembling hand as he ascended. Each step sent a jolt of pain through his side, but he gritted his teeth and pushed forward. He had no idea what he was climbing toward, but staying put wasn’t an option.

As he reached the landing for the eighth floor, his eyes locked onto the door. More specifically, something on the door. As he drew closer, he stared in disbelief at what he was seeing.

Fuck. Why is my luck so bad?
