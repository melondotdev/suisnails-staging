Bright lights swirled above him, and muffled voices cut through the haze.

“Abdominal stab wound—just missed the liver.”

“Vitals are stable, but we need to scan for internal bleeding.”

Daniel’s consciousness flickered, fragments of the surgery room seeping into his mind like a surreal fever dream. The sterile lights blurred, and the voices faded into a distant hum. Somewhere deep in the void of his fading awareness, something stirred.

A faint glow emerged in the darkness, pulsing like a heartbeat. At first, it was warm and inviting, pulling Daniel toward it. But as he drifted closer, the glow began to shift, growing jagged and alien. Strange shapes coiled within it, abstract and incomprehensible, their edges writhing like shadows cast by an unseen fire.

Suddenly, he was falling—not through space, but through a dream of tangled memories. He saw flashes of tentacled forms moving through a black ocean, their sheer size and malevolence pressing down on him like a physical weight. A wave of suffocating sadness crashed over him, accompanied by the ghostly cries of people he didn’t recognize but somehow felt he should. Faces blurred together, their expressions twisted in agony before vanishing into the void.

In the final vision, the miasma reformed into something towering and incomprehensible. A presence—not human, not even close—loomed over him. It had no face, only an endless depth of shifting patterns and eyes that seemed to pierce through him. Its silent gaze bore into his very being, and he felt its judgment.

Daniel jolted awake, his body drenched in sweat. His heart pounded against his ribs, the rhythmic beeping of a monitor grounding him in the present. The room was unnervingly quiet, its fluorescent lights casting a harsh, sterile glow. His head throbbed as he struggled to orient himself, the faint scent of antiseptic filling his nostrils.

Where was he? And what the hell was that dream?

A sharp pain in his side reminded him that he had gotten stabbed. Stabbed! In Canada, of all places!

He carefully lifted his shirt, discovering clean bandages around his abdomen where the bearded man had done the deed. He was in a hospital, then. Breathing a sigh of relief, he took stock of his body.

Seeing the shaking in his hands, he probably wasn’t in the best shape of his life, but at least he was alive. Though…

He flexed his trembling hands, staring at them as though they belonged to someone else. Something felt... wrong, like the world had shifted ever so slightly out of alignment. The dream—nightmare, more like—lingered in his mind, its vivid flashes of faceless beings, writhing tentacles, and suffocating despair lingered just beneath his thoughts like a specter. He didn’t recognize any of the faces he’d seen, but his chest tightened for some reason when he tried to recall them.

Shaking himself free from his thoughts, Daniel stared up at the white ceiling for a while. He expected himself to feel… anger? Frustration? He had just been stabbed, after all. However, for the first time in a long time, all he felt was a strange calmness. Not peacefulness, but more akin to a kind of calmness one feels when they have control over a situation.

He felt no resentment towards the man that had stabbed him. Well, okay, maybe a little resentment. No matter how much of a dick he was at the casino table, that was no reason to chase after someone, stab them, and take their money. Really, what kind of psychopath did that? Yeah, screw that guy.

The door creaked open, breaking his spiraling thoughts. A middle-aged doctor with ginger hair and beard stepped inside, clipboard in hand. He wore a calm expression as he approached.

“Mr. Kang.” The doctor spoke with a thick accent Daniel couldn’t quite put his finger on. Scottish, maybe? “I’m glad that you’ve regained consciousness. How are you feeling?”

Daniel swallowed hard, throat parched. “Like I got stabbed,” he joked, voice raspy. He chuckled dryly, eliciting a sharp pain in his side.

The doctor nodded, offering a faint, practiced smile. “You’re lucky,” he said, glancing at his notes. “The blade missed your major organs. There’s some tissue damage, but nothing life threatening. You’ve been stitched up and given a transfusion to compensate for the blood loss. You’ll be sore for a while, so try not to laugh while that wound heals.”

Daniel nodded slowly, taking it in.

“Is there anyone you would like us to contact for you?” the doctor asked. “We didn’t find any emergency contacts listed in your medical records.”

“No,” Daniel blurted out immediately, causing him to cough painfully and drawing a raised eyebrow from the doctor. “It’s okay, I’ll do it myself,” he reassured.

The doctor handed him a glass of water, which he drank from and handed back gratefully.

All the people he could potentially reach out to flashed through his mind. His father, mother, older brother, and younger sister… no way any of them would come to the hospital out of concern for him; not after what he did to them. Mei, on the other hand—

He cringed internally as he remembered the argument he had with Mei before the incident. What a shitshow that was. The woman had been trying to show her concern for him, and all he did was act like a textbook crack addict facing an unwanted intervention. He buried his face in his hands, face hot with shame.

The doctor seemed to take this action the wrong way. “I understand this is a lot to take in, Mr. Kang. You’ve just gone through a traumatic event, and it’s quite natural to feel scared in this sort of situation. Are you sure you wouldn’t like us to call someone for you?”

Daniel sighed and shook his head. He’d have to apologize to Mei later. “So, the guy who attacked me,” he said, changing the subject. “Did they catch him?”

The doctor hesitated before answering. “I’m afraid I don’t have much information on that. The police have asked you to contact them when you wake up so that they can get your statement. I’d wait until you’re feeling better, though. You probably don’t want they poking and prodding you for information while you still have a hole in your side.”

“I see. Thanks.” Daniel supposed that was to be expected. 

He frowned. Normally, he’d get riled up about something like this and contact the police immediately. He’d do everything in his power to shake the other guy down for compensation… and probably gamble with the money he received. But now, that sort of thing seemed… petty? Almost like it was a waste of his time. 

That was bizzare. It’s not like he had anything else going on in his life right now, and the guy definitely had stolen all the money he had, meaning Daniel was out of cash (thank God for free Canadian healthcare) and in debt. Going after the guy was not only vengeful, but rational.

Even so, he couldn’t deny how he felt. If he didn’t have this injury, he felt like he’d rather be doing something productive. Getting his health back, or making up with Mei, perhaps. Maybe even getting a job? Woah. That was an even stranger thought. What was going on with him?

There was something else nagging him too, which he couldn’t shake since he woke up. Usually, even the most terrifying nightmares would have been forgotten by now, but his most recent one was still fresh in his mind. Not all the details were clear. Trying to remember a specific scene was like trying to track the path of a single noodle through a plate of spaghetti.

He scratched his head, trying to unravel the spaghetti with little success.

His stomach growled, and the doctor chuckled. “I’ll have one of the nurses bring a meal. Please get some rest, Mr. Kang. Don’t hesitate to let me know if you have any further questions. I’ll be back to check on you later.” With that, he stepped out of the room, leaving Daniel to his thoughts.

Daniel glanced around and spotted his phone on the bedside table. Unsurprisingly, there was a string of missed call and text notifications from Mei. He winced as he scrolled through the texts.

> I don’t know how much longer I can do this, Daniel. I can’t keep watching you throw your life away. I’m worried about you, but I’m not going to let you drag me down with you. If we can’t talk like adults, I’m done. 

> Daniel, where are you? Are you ignoring me? 

> What the hell is wrong with you? Grow up, seriously.

> Can we talk? Or at least text me back. Just… let me know if you’re safe.

> I’m calling the police if you don’t reply today. I’m worried about you.

Looking at the date and time, he discovered that it had been nearly two days since the stabbing already, and it was now already 11 PM at night.

‘Great job, Daniel. You didn’t only lash out at the only person left in your life, but you also got stabbed and caused her to worry for two entire days,’ he thought to himself. 

After a small struggle trying to figure out what he could possibly say to save their relationship, he sent her a short message:

> Mei, I’m sorry for everything. I’m in the hospital. Got stabbed, but I’m okay—well, sort of. I’ll explain more soon. I know I messed up again, and you have every right to be angry. Please let me make it right. I’m so sorry.

He wasn’t sure if it would be enough to patch the rift he’d created, but it was honest, at least. For now, that would have to be enough.

The adrenaline that had kept him upright started to wane, and he felt the weight of the injury—no, the weight of everything—settling onto his chest. His eyelids drooped, and despite the dull ache in his side and the raw sting of shame in his mind, he let himself sink into the pillows. He couldn’t fix everything tonight. But maybe tomorrow, he could begin.

With a long, ragged breath, Daniel let the drowsiness take him, drifting into a fitful sleep filled with hazy images of everything he’d been running from—and everything he might finally be ready to face.

By the time Daniel awoke, a grey morning light struggled to break through. Though the hospital’s fluorescent lights were dimmed, his eyes still felt sensitive, and he squinted at the half-drawn blinds. A dull, insistent throb in his side reminded him of the stitches.

He reached for his phone, still groggy as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes. There were several notifications—almost all from Mei.

> You were STABBED?! Which hospital are you at?

> Nvm, I figured it out. I’m on my way.

Daniel barely had time to process the message before the door to his room burst open, slamming against the wall with a startling thud. He flinched, his body tensing, and then Mei appeared, breathless and disheveled, her eyes wide with panic.

They locked eyes, the air in the room suddenly thick with tension. Mei’s lips moved as if she wanted to say something, but no words came out. Daniel opened his mouth to break the silence, to apologize, to explain, but nothing seemed right. His chest felt tight.

“Mei—” he began, his voice hoarse.

Before he could get another word out, Mei crossed the room in three swift strides and threw her arms around him. The impact jolted his stitches, and he let out a sharp hiss of pain, but he didn’t push her away. Her grip was tight, almost desperate, and he felt her trembling.

“You idiot,” she said, her voice muffled against his shoulder. “You absolute idiot. What the hell were you thinking? Do you have any idea how worried I’ve been?”

Daniel’s throat tightened. He wasn’t sure if it was the relief of her being there or the guilt that came with her words. “Mei, I—”

“No!” she interrupted, pulling back just enough to glare at him, tears brimming in her eyes. “You don’t get to talk right now. Do you have any idea what I’ve been through these past two days? You disappeared after telling me nothing but excuses, and then you go radio silent. I thought the worst! I thought one of those people you owe money to had done this to you, Daniel.”

Her words hit harder than he expected. He swallowed the lump in his throat, his hands fidgeting with the edge of the hospital blanket. “I didn’t mean for any of this to happen.”

“You never do,” she snapped, wiping at her eyes with the back of her hand. “But it always does. I was ready to call the police, Daniel. I thought... I thought I’d lost you.”

“I’m sorry,” he said, his voice barely audible. “I should’ve called. I didn’t mean to make you worry.”

“You think sorry fixes this?” she shot back, though her voice cracked. “You think I’m mad because you didn’t call me? Daniel, I thought you were dead.”

Daniel looked away, shame twisting his gut. “I didn’t... I wasn’t thinking.”

“Clearly,” she muttered bitterly. Her anger seemed to cool slightly as she took a deep breath, her shoulders slumping. “You’re okay. That’s all that matters.”

For a moment, silence settled between them. Mei sat down in the chair beside his bed, her expression unreadable. Daniel could feel the weight of the conversation they were about to have, and he hated it. He wasn’t ready.

Her eyes flicked to the bandages wrapped around his abdomen. “Does it hurt?” she asked, her voice quieter now, the anger giving way to concern. “The wound, I mean.”

Daniel glanced down at his side, then back at her. “Not as bad as you’d think,” he said, trying to sound nonchalant. “The doctors patched me up pretty good. They said it missed anything major.”

Mei’s brows furrowed, her hands gripping the armrest of the chair. “But why, Daniel? What happened? Was this because of the debt?”

His stomach twisted at her words. He thought about lying, brushing it off as random bad luck, but the look in her eyes made it clear she wouldn’t buy it. “No,” he said finally. “It wasn’t about the debt. It was just... some guy. I pissed him off at the casino.”

Her jaw tightened. “The casino,” she said, her voice dropping. “Of course.”

“It wasn’t like that,” Daniel said quickly, though even to his own ears, it sounded hollow. “I didn’t think it would escalate.”

“Nothing you ever do seems to escalate—until it does,” she snapped. “Daniel, this isn’t just a string of bad luck anymore. This is a pattern. A dangerous one. And I’m tired of watching it destroy you.”

Her words were like a punch to the gut. “Mei, I—”

“I’m glad you’re okay, Daniel,” she said finally, cutting him off. Her tone softened, but it didn’t lose its edge. “But this... this isn’t working. I can’t keep doing this.”

His stomach sank. “Mei, wait. Please, don’t—”

She held up a hand, stopping him. “Let me finish. I’ve thought about this for a long time. I care about you—I always have. But I can’t keep putting myself through this. The gambling, the debts, the lies, the constant worry... I deserve better than this. And so do you.”

Daniel opened his mouth, searching for something to say, anything to convince her to stay. “I can change,” he said weakly. “I swear, I’ll do better.”

Mei shook her head, a sad smile tugging at her lips. “You’ve said that before. And maybe you mean it this time, but I can’t wait around to see if it’s true. I can’t keep sacrificing my peace of mind for a ‘maybe.’”

“I need you,” he said, his voice breaking. “I don’t know what I’ll do without you.”

“You’ll figure it out,” she said gently, reaching out to squeeze his hand. “You’re stronger than you think, Daniel. But you have to want to be better—for yourself, not for me.”

He felt a hot sting behind his eyes but forced himself to hold back the tears. Mei stood, her hand lingering on his for a moment before she let go. “Take care of yourself, okay? And... please, get help.”

He nodded stiffly, unable to look at her. The sound of her footsteps echoed in the room as she walked to the door. She paused, her hand on the handle, and glanced back at him. “Goodbye, Daniel.”

As the door clicked shut behind Mei, Daniel let out a shaky breath, his chest hollow and aching. He stared at the empty doorway, the weight of her absence pressing down on him like a suffocating fog. The room, already oppressive in its sterile silence, suddenly felt even emptier.

“Well, that was rough,” came a voice from behind the curtain separating the room. Daniel flinched, turning his head sharply toward the sound.

The curtain rustled, and then a man—probably in his mid-thirties—poked his head around. He had a buzz cut, a crooked grin, and a hospital gown that looked like it had seen better days. “Women, huh? They’re all the same.”

Daniel blinked, too stunned to reply. He hadn’t even realized he had a roommate.

The man leaned further out, propping himself up on his elbow. “Look, buddy, don’t sweat it. Plenty of fish in the sea, right? Bet you she’s already replaced you with some guy who doesn’t smell like antiseptic and regret.”

Daniel’s jaw tightened, the casual cruelty of the remark hitting harder than it should have. “What’s wrong with you?” he snapped, his voice rising.

The man raised his hands in mock surrender. “Whoa, relax, Saint Andrews. Just trying to lighten the mood. You’re in a hospital bed, man. Don’t you think you’ve got bigger problems than some chick walking out?”

Daniel glared at him, fists clenching the edge of the hospital blanket. “You don’t know anything about me, so shut up.”

The man smirked, clearly unfazed. “I know you’re the kind of guy who gets himself stabbed. And let me guess—gambling debt? Or was it something even dumber?”

Daniel’s glare darkened. “It’s none of your business.”

“Touchy, touchy,” the man said with a chuckle. “Guess I hit a nerve. But seriously, you should be thanking me for the life advice. Sounds like you could use it. No wonder she left you.”

“That’s enough!” Daniel barked, his voice sharp and filled with frustration. “You don’t get to eavesdrop on a private conversation and then make comments about it. You’re out of line.”

The man rolled his eyes, reclining back against his pillows. “Private conversation? In a shared hospital room? Yeah, okay, buddy. Let me know when you find your moral high ground again. I’m sure it’s next to the casino chips.”

Daniel opened his mouth to retort, but no words came. Instead, he let out a heavy sigh and turned away, his eyes falling on the tray of food that had been left on his bedside table. He hadn’t even noticed it earlier, but now, the scent of hospital spaghetti—watery sauce and all—made his stomach growl.

He reached for the tray, ignoring the smug grin he could feel from the other man. Fork in hand, he twirled the noodles absentmindedly, his mind drifting back to Mei. Her words echoed in his head, each one cutting deeper than the last.

She was right. She was absolutely right. Who would want to stay with someone like him? Someone who lied, gambled, and dragged others down with him. He’d treated her horribly—worse than she deserved—and yet she had still come to the hospital, worried sick, to see him. And what had he given her in return? A reason to leave.

He took a bite of the spaghetti, the blandness of it grounding him. For the first time in what felt like forever, he didn’t feel defensive or angry. He felt... ashamed. Mei had been the best thing in his life, and he’d pushed her away.

As much as it stung, he supposed she was in the right. She deserved better. Anyone would.

But as he sat there, chewing the rubbery noodles, a thought began to form in the back of his mind. Maybe it wasn’t too late—not to win her back, necessarily, but to prove to her, and to himself, that he could be better. That he wasn’t just the mess she’d walked away from.

For some reason he couldn’t quite explain, Daniel felt a strange sense of anticipation. It was almost as if the universe had hit a pause button, giving him a moment to reflect before the next chapter of his life began. A chance for redemption. He didn’t know what it would look like or when it would come, but he felt it—like a faint glimmer on the horizon.

The obnoxious roommate let out a loud snore, and Daniel rolled his eyes, a faint smirk tugging at his lips despite everything. “Plenty of fish in the sea,” he muttered under his breath, shaking his head. “What a moron.”

He twirled another forkful of spaghetti, his grip on the utensil tightening. Mei was right to leave, but she wasn’t wrong about him being capable of more. For the first time in a long time, he believed it, too.
